# About the Survey of Software

> **SoS**: Systematic research on general-purpose libraries, tools, and frameworks.

## Mapping the Software Landscape

**The software library landscape is unmapped.** Each library has its own documentation, but there's no systematic survey across the category. When you need a JSON parser or graph algorithm library, you're on your own to figure out what exists and which one to pick.

**That's why this exists.** Like a surveying expedition, we're systematically measuring the landscape—one triangulation point at a time. I needed these measurements for my own projects. Now you don't have to do the research.

## What We Catalog

✅ **General-purpose software components:**
- Algorithm libraries (sorting, graph algorithms, compression)
- Data processing tools (JSON parsing, serialization, streaming)
- ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Infrastructure components (databases, messaging, caching)
- Development tools (testing, logging, monitoring)
- **The nuts, bolts, and power tools of software**

❌ **What we exclude:**
- Application-specific integrations
- Vertical-specific solutions (e.g., language learning apps)
- Business logic implementations
- Custom SaaS platforms

**The Hardware Store Principle:** This catalog covers components you'd find in a hardware store—general-purpose tools, not custom applications.

## The Four-Pass Discovery Framework

Each research piece uses the **Four-Pass Discovery Framework** - four methodologies that reveal different aspects of the solution space:

### S1: Rapid Discovery
**Philosophy:** "Popular libraries exist for a reason"
**Approach:** Speed-focused, ecosystem-driven discovery
**When to use:** Need fast, proven solutions

### S2: Comprehensive Analysis
**Philosophy:** "Understand the entire solution space before choosing"
**Approach:** Thorough, evidence-based, optimization-focused
**When to use:** Complex problems requiring deep analysis

### S3: Need-Driven Discovery
**Philosophy:** "Start with requirements, find exact-fit solutions"
**Approach:** Requirement-focused, validation-oriented
**When to use:** Specific use cases where generic solutions fall short

### S4: Strategic Selection
**Philosophy:** "Think long-term and consider broader context"
**Approach:** Balanced, future-focused, ecosystem-aware
**When to use:** Architectural decisions with multi-year implications

### Explainer
**Philosophy:** "Make it accessible to everyone"
**Approach:** Domain fundamentals for readers new to the technology
**When to use:** Building foundational understanding

**Why multiple perspectives?** Different discovery approaches reveal different optimal solutions. Single-methodology discovery misses potentially better paths.

## How To Use This Research

### For Decision-Making

1. **Start with S1** - Get the landscape in 5-10 minutes
2. **Read S4** - Strategic insights for long-term choices
3. **Check Explainer** - If you're new to the domain
4. **Deep dive S2/S3** - When you need comprehensive details

### For Learning

1. **Read Explainer first** - Build foundational understanding
2. **Skim S1** - See what's possible in the domain
3. **Study S3** - Understand methodology and use cases
4. **Reference S2** - Technical deep-dive when needed

### For Architecture

- **S4 insights** reveal patterns across the ecosystem
- **S3 methodologies** inform your evaluation approach
- **S2 technical analysis** provides implementation details

## Quality Standards

**Research-grade confidence** (not Consumer Reports certainty):
- S1 Rapid: 70-80% confidence (speed-optimized)
- S2 Comprehensive: 80-90% confidence (depth-optimized)
- S3 Need-Driven: 75-85% confidence (context-specific)
- S4 Strategic: 60-70% confidence (forward-looking)

**Information decay** - Library ecosystems evolve:
- At publication: 70-80% accuracy
- 12 months: 50-70% accuracy
- 36 months: &lt;30% accuracy

Treat research as living documents that guide investigation, not gospel truth.
