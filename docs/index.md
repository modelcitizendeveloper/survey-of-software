# Survey of Software

> A methodological approach to library selection

**Like the Great Trigonometrical Survey mapped India over 70 years, we're systematically measuring the software library landscape.** Each research piece is a triangulation point—a precise measurement you can use to navigate your own technical decisions.

---

## What We Catalog

✅ **General-purpose software components:**
- Algorithm libraries (sorting, graph algorithms, compression)
- Data processing tools (JSON parsing, serialization, streaming)
- ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Infrastructure components (databases, messaging, caching)
- Development tools (testing, logging, monitoring)

❌ **What we exclude:**
- Application-specific integrations
- Vertical-specific solutions
- Business logic implementations
- Custom SaaS platforms

**The principle:** We catalog components you'd find in a hardware store—general-purpose tools, not custom applications.
