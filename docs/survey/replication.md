# Replicating This Research

> **Systematic library research is replicable.** The methodology behind every research piece is open, documented, and ready for you to apply to your own challenges.

## Why Open the Methodology?

**Open source tools are available to everyone now.** The vision is to help organizations DIY solutions they would have paid vendors for before. This research—and the methodology behind it—accelerates that.

**If the research helps you, the methodology can help you research what *you* need.**

## The Four-Pass Survey (4PS)

The 4PS uses four independent discovery methodologies that explore solution spaces from different angles:

### S1: Rapid Discovery
**Philosophy:** "Popular libraries exist for a reason"

Speed-focused, ecosystem-driven. GitHub stars, download counts, community adoption. Get 70% of the value in 10 minutes.

### S2: Comprehensive Analysis
**Philosophy:** "Understand the entire solution space before choosing"

Performance benchmarks, feature matrices, deep trade-off analysis. Know everything before committing.

### S3: Need-Driven Discovery
**Philosophy:** "Start with requirements, find exact-fit solutions"

Use case mapping, requirement validation. Does this actually solve your specific problem?

### S4: Strategic Selection
**Philosophy:** "Think long-term and consider broader context"

Maintenance health, vendor risk, ecosystem momentum. Will this survive for years?

## Why Four Approaches?

**Different methodologies reveal different optimal solutions.** Single-methodology discovery misses potentially better paths.

- S1 finds what works fast
- S2 finds what optimizes best
- S3 finds what fits requirements exactly
- S4 finds what survives long-term

**The convergence pattern:** When 3-4 methodologies agree, that's a strong signal. When they disagree, you've discovered a trade-off worth understanding.

## What You Get

The complete methodology includes:

- **Agent prompt templates** for each methodology (S1-S4)
- **Independence protocols** (prevent cross-contamination)
- **Directory structures** for organizing research
- **Execution workflows** (parallel vs sequential)
- **Quality standards** and confidence levels
- **Step-by-step replication guide** (copy-paste prompts for Claude Code)

**Everything used to create the 40+ research pieces in this survey.**

## Confidence Levels & Limitations

This research provides **strategic direction**, not Consumer Reports certainty:

- **S1 Rapid:** 70-80% confidence (speed-optimized)
- **S2 Comprehensive:** 80-90% confidence (depth-optimized)
- **S3 Need-Driven:** 75-85% confidence (context-specific)
- **S4 Strategic:** 60-70% confidence (forward-looking)

**Information decay:**
- At publication: 70-80% accuracy
- 12 months: 50-70% accuracy
- 36 months: <30% accuracy

Library ecosystems evolve. Treat research as living documents that guide investigation, not gospel truth.

## When to Use 4PS

**The hardware store principle:** This methodology works for general-purpose libraries, tools, and infrastructure—not application-specific solutions.

**Good candidates:**
- Algorithm libraries (sorting, graph algorithms, compression)
- Data processing tools (JSON, serialization, streaming)
- ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Infrastructure components (caching, logging, testing)
- Development tools (linters, formatters, bundlers)

**Not a fit:**
- Custom business logic
- Vertical-specific applications
- Proprietary integrations

**Think:** Components you'd find in a hardware store, not custom buildings.

The methodology page includes:
- Detailed explanation of each pass
- Independence protocols
- Copy-paste prompt templates for Claude Code
- Execution workflows
- Tips for successful replication

**Or:** Start small with S1 rapid discovery on a category you need. You'll get 70% of the value in 10 minutes, then decide if deeper analysis is worth it.
