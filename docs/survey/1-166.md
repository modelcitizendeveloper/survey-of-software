# OCR for CJK Text: Domain Explainer

## What This Solves

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for CJK languages tackles a fundamental problem: converting images of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text into editable, searchable digital text.

**The core challenge**: While Latin-alphabet OCR deals with ~26 letters, CJK OCR must distinguish between potentially **100,000+ ideographic characters**. This isn't just "OCR with more symbols" - it's a qualitatively different problem requiring specialized approaches.

**Who encounters this**:
- Financial institutions processing invoices from Asian suppliers
- Healthcare systems digitizing patient records with mixed English/Chinese text
- Legal firms handling contracts in multiple Asian languages
- Logistics companies processing customs forms across Asia-Pacific
- Government agencies verifying ID cards and official documents
- Manufacturing companies managing supplier documentation from China, Japan, and Korea

**Why it matters**: Without CJK-specific OCR, organizations either resort to expensive manual data entry or risk errors from systems designed for alphabetic languages. A single misread character in a Chinese invoice could mean confusing 万 (10,000) with 方 (direction) - catastrophic for financial processing.

## Accessible Analogies

### The Scale Problem

Imagine organizing a library:
- **Latin OCR**: You have 26 boxes (letters A-Z). Sort books by first letter.
- **CJK OCR**: You have 100,000 boxes. Many look almost identical - like having 50 boxes all labeled "木" but with tiny variations meaning "tree," "wood," "forest," or "lumber."

### The Word Boundary Problem

**Space-delimited languages** (English, Korean): Like items on a shelf with clear dividers between them.

**Non-delimited languages** (Chinese, Japanese): Like items packed tightly in a box with no separators. The OCR system must figure out where one "item" ends and another begins based on context and patterns alone.

### The Multi-Script Challenge

Japanese text mixes three writing systems in one sentence:
- Kanji (complex ideographs borrowed from Chinese)
- Hiragana (phonetic syllabary for grammar)
- Katakana (phonetic syllabary for foreign words)

This is like reading a document that randomly switches between Roman letters, Greek alphabet, and Egyptian hieroglyphics - all in one paragraph. The OCR system must recognize and switch contexts seamlessly.

### The Vertical Text Issue

Japanese documents often write vertically (top to bottom, right to left). Imagine if English alternated between horizontal left-to-right and vertical reading - your OCR system would need to:
1. Detect the orientation
2. Adjust processing pipeline
3. Maintain correct reading order
4. Export results that preserve layout

## When You Need This

### Clear Decision Criteria

**You need CJK-specific OCR if**:
- Processing any documents containing Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text
- Handling multilingual documents mixing CJK and Latin scripts
- Digitizing historical archives from Asian countries
- Automating data entry from government forms, receipts, or invoices in Asian languages
- Building systems for Asia-Pacific operations

**You DON'T need CJK-specific OCR if**:
- Your documents are purely Latin-alphabet languages
- You only process born-digital documents (no scanning)
- Volume is low enough that manual entry is faster
- Your use case is purely English or Western European languages

### Concrete Use Cases

**Financial Services**: Chinese banks use OCR to process checks and ATM transactions. A Western bank opening Asia-Pacific operations needs the same capability to process supplier invoices written in Simplified Chinese.

**Healthcare**: A hospital network with Chinese-speaking patients must digitize handwritten prescription notes that mix English drug names with Chinese dosage instructions.

**Logistics**: A shipping company needs to extract data from bills of lading written in Japanese (vertical text), Chinese (no word spaces), and English (standard horizontal) - all on the same document.

**Identity Verification**: KYC compliance requires extracting data from Chinese national ID cards, Japanese driver's licenses, and Korean resident registration cards - each with different layouts and character sets.

## Trade-offs

### The Core Choice: Open Source vs Commercial

**Open Source** (Tesseract, PaddleOCR, EasyOCR):
- **Pro**: Free, self-hosted, no vendor lock-in
- **Pro**: Full control over data (critical for compliance)
- **Pro**: Can fine-tune models for specific document types
- **Con**: Lower accuracy on complex documents (87-96% vs 99.8%)
- **Con**: Requires ML/CV expertise to optimize
- **Con**: No enterprise SLAs or support
- **Con**: GPU needed for acceptable performance

**Commercial** (ABBYY, Google Cloud Vision, Azure AI):
- **Pro**: 99%+ accuracy, ready to use
- **Pro**: Managed service, no infrastructure
- **Pro**: Enterprise support and SLAs
- **Pro**: Handle complex layouts automatically
- **Con**: Usage-based pricing ($$$)
- **Con**: Vendor lock-in
- **Con**: Data leaves your infrastructure (compliance risk)
- **Con**: Less customization

### Complexity vs Capability Spectrum

**Simple** → **Advanced**:

1. **EasyOCR**: Install, run, get 80+ languages. Best for quick prototypes.
2. **Tesseract**: Mature ecosystem, 100+ languages, moderate setup.
3. **PaddleOCR**: Highest accuracy for CJK, requires GPU and tuning.
4. **Commercial APIs**: Highest accuracy, easiest setup, ongoing costs.
5. **Custom VLM**: Cutting-edge (DeepSeek-OCR, Qwen2-VL), requires advanced ML team.

### Build vs Buy Considerations

**Build (open source) when**:
- Budget < $10K/year
- Data cannot leave your infrastructure (HIPAA, GDPR, national security)
- Processing Chinese documents specifically (PaddleOCR has Baidu's optimization)
- Have GPU infrastructure already
- Volume is predictable

**Buy (commercial) when**:
- Accuracy is non-negotiable (legal, compliance)
- No ML/CV expertise in-house
- Volume is highly variable (pay per use)
- Need results in days, not months
- Multi-region deployment (leverage vendor infrastructure)

### Self-Hosted vs Cloud Services

**Self-hosted** (Tesseract, PaddleOCR on your servers):
- Full data control
- Fixed costs after initial setup
- Requires infrastructure and maintenance
- Scales linearly with volume

**Cloud** (Google Cloud Vision, Azure AI):
- No infrastructure management
- Pay per API call
- Auto-scales to any volume
- Data governance considerations

## Cost Considerations

### Open Source: "Free" But Not Zero

**Infrastructure costs**:
- GPU instance: $300-1000/month (AWS p3.2xlarge ~$3/hr)
- Storage for models: ~10GB per language pack
- Development time: 2-4 weeks for production-ready setup

**Hidden costs**:
- ML engineer salary: $120-200K/year (part-time allocation)
- Model tuning for your specific documents: 40-80 hours
- Maintenance and updates: 10 hours/month

**Break-even**: If processing `<100`K pages/year, commercial APIs often cheaper than managing infrastructure.

### Commercial APIs: Pay Per Use

**Google Cloud Vision OCR**:
- $0-1M units/month: $1.50 per 1,000 units
- 1M-5M units: $1.00 per 1,000
- 5M+ units: $0.60 per 1,000
- (1 unit = 1 page or 1 API call)

**Azure AI Document Intelligence**:
- Free tier: 500 pages/month
- Standard: $0.00125 per page (S0 tier)
- Volume discounts available

**Realistic example**: Processing 50,000 invoices/month:
- Google Cloud Vision: ~$75/month (at $1.50/1K rate)
- Self-hosted PaddleOCR: $300/month GPU + $15K setup + maintenance

**When commercial makes sense**: Variable volume, `<100`K pages/month, need 99%+ accuracy, no ML team.

**When open source makes sense**: `>500`K pages/month, predictable volume, have ML expertise, data sensitivity.

## Implementation Reality

### Realistic Timeline Expectations

**Week 1-2: Evaluation**
- Test sample documents with EasyOCR (easiest start)
- Benchmark accuracy on your specific document types
- Test with PaddleOCR if Chinese documents are primary use case
- Decision point: build vs buy

**If Open Source:**
- **Week 3-4**: Set up infrastructure (GPU instances, model storage)
- **Week 5-8**: Fine-tune for your document types (critical - generic models may only hit 85%)
- **Week 9-12**: Build preprocessing pipeline (deskew, denoise, contrast adjustment)
- **Month 4**: Production deployment, monitoring

**If Commercial:**
- **Week 3**: API integration (typically 2-3 days)
- **Week 4**: Testing and validation
- **Month 2**: Production deployment

### Team Skill Requirements

**Open Source Path**:
- ML Engineer (model tuning, evaluation): 40 hours
- Backend Developer (API integration, pipeline): 60 hours
- DevOps (infrastructure, GPU optimization): 40 hours

**Commercial API Path**:
- Backend Developer (API integration): 20 hours
- No ML expertise required

### Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

**Pitfall 1: "OCR is a solved problem"**
- Reality: Generic OCR hits 70-85% on CJK. Production systems need 95%+.
- Fix: Budget time for document-specific tuning.

**Pitfall 2: "More languages = better for my use case"**
- Reality: Tesseract has 100+ languages but PaddleOCR (80 languages) outperforms on Chinese invoices.
- Fix: Test on YOUR documents, not generic benchmarks.

**Pitfall 3: "Accuracy is the only metric"**
- Reality: Speed, layout preservation, and error types matter.
- Fix: Define success criteria beyond accuracy (e.g., "extract correct total from invoice 99% of time").

**Pitfall 4: "Commercial APIs are always better"**
- Reality: For Chinese documents, PaddleOCR (free) often matches/beats commercial APIs.
- Fix: Run bake-off with real documents before committing.

**Pitfall 5: "Vertical Japanese text is just rotated horizontal"**
- Reality: Reading order, furigana placement, and mixed horizontal inserts require special handling.
- Fix: Use jpn_vert models or verify commercial API handles tategaki correctly.

### First 90 Days: What to Expect

**Month 1: Discovery**
- Collect representative sample documents (100+ pages)
- Test 2-3 solutions on samples
- Discover edge cases (handwriting, stamps, low-quality scans)
- Realize accuracy is lower than hoped

**Month 2: Iteration**
- Implement preprocessing (biggest accuracy gains here)
- Fine-tune models or adjust API parameters
- Build error handling for common failures
- Get to 90% accuracy

**Month 3: Production Hardening**
- Handle remaining 10% edge cases
- Build monitoring and alerting
- Create human review workflow for low-confidence results
- Achieve production-ready 95%+ accuracy

**The 90-10 rule**: 90% accuracy is achievable in weeks. 95%+ takes months of edge case handling.

## Key Insights

1. **CJK OCR is not "OCR with more letters"** - it's a fundamentally different problem requiring specialized approaches for character segmentation, word boundary detection, and multi-script handling.

2. **The Baidu advantage**: For Chinese-heavy workloads, PaddleOCR (open source from Baidu) often outperforms commercial Western APIs despite being free - because it was built by Chinese engineers for Chinese documents.

3. **Preprocessing matters more than model choice**: 80% of accuracy improvements come from proper image preprocessing (deskew, denoise, contrast adjustment) not from choosing the "best" OCR engine.

4. **No single best solution**: The right choice depends on your specific mix of languages, document types, volume, and data governance requirements. Run benchmarks on YOUR documents.

5. **The 95% barrier**: Getting from 90% to 95% accuracy takes as much effort as getting from 0% to 90%. Budget accordingly and decide if human review workflows are cheaper than pursuing that last 5%.
