# Overview: CJK OCR Fundamentals

## What is OCR for CJK Text?

OCR for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text refers to specialized optical character recognition systems designed to handle the unique challenges of East Asian writing systems.

## Why CJK OCR is Different

CJK text recognition presents fundamentally different challenges compared to Latin alphabet OCR:

### Character Set Complexity
- **Scale**: Unicode defines [101,996 characters in the CJK Unified Ideographs set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs)
- **Classes**: [Large number of character classes creates high probability of confusions between similar character shapes](https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-0-85729-859-1_14)
- **Monospacing**: [CJK characters are typically monospaced/fixed-pitch](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/docs/MOCRadaptingtesseract2.pdf)

### Language-Specific Differences
- **Word boundaries**: [Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces between words, unlike Korean](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab/issues/191)
- **Mixed scripts**: Japanese uses Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji in the same text
- **Vertical text**: Japanese often written vertically (top to bottom, right to left)

### Handwriting Challenges
- **Shape variations**: [Primary difficulty comes from writers' habits, styles, and times](https://pnclink.org/annual/annual2000/2000pdf/4-7-3.pdf)
- **Cursive strings**: Classical CJK text requires preprocessing from color filtering to segmentation
- **Seals and stamps**: Traditional documents include seals that must be distinguished from text

## When You Need CJK-Specific OCR

**Use CJK OCR when**:
- Processing documents in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean
- Handling mixed-script documents (e.g., Japanese with Kanji + Hiragana)
- Working with vertical text layouts (Japanese publications)
- Dealing with historical or classical CJK texts
- Processing forms with thousands of possible character classes

**General OCR is insufficient because**:
- Latin-focused OCR trained on 26-letter alphabets can't handle 100,000+ ideographs
- Word segmentation algorithms assume space-delimited words
- Character similarity detection needs CJK-specific training
- [Pattern training not supported for CJK in some commercial systems](https://support.abbyy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003422379-Using-pattern-training-for-Chinese-Japanese-and-Korean-CJK-languages-in-FineReader-Engine)

## Key Insight

The fundamental challenge is scale and ambiguity: [CJK languages have large symbol sets and lack clear word boundaries, posing serious tests for classification engines designed for well-delimited words from small alphabets](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/docs/MOCRadaptingtesseract2.pdf).

# Tesseract LSTM Architecture

## Overview

[Tesseract Version 4 employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/). [This neural network-based recognition engine delivers significantly higher accuracy than previous versions](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-lstm).

## How It Works

[The input image is processed in boxes (rectangles) line by line, feeding into the LSTM model](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig6Internal-Architecture-of-OCR-Tesseract-8-Version-4-has-a-dataset-knowledge-of_fig3_341779791). [Tesseract 4 focuses on line recognition](https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-text-recognition-ocr-using-tesseract-and-opencv/).

## Architecture Components

[To recognize a single character, CNNs are typically used. For arbitrary-length text (sequences of characters), RNNs are used, with LSTM being a popular form](https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/).

[The network specification string describes the architecture](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-ocr/c/ZuXSyBDvPhk/m/vcZWc8FjAAAJ). Example: `[1,36,0,1Ct3,3,16Mp3,3Lfys64Lfx96Lrx96Lfx512O1c1]` includes:
- **Ct3,3,16**: 3x3 convolution with 16 filters
- **Mp3,3**: Max pooling layers
- **Lfys64, Lfx96, Lrx96, Lfx512**: LSTM layers in different dimensions

## CJK-Specific Configurations

[For CJK languages, page segmentation mode (--psm) settings are important](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/tess5/TrainingTesseract-5.html). [The .traineddata files include script-specific configurations, including vertical text detection in jpn_vert.traineddata](https://deepwiki.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/6-developer-guide).

## Training Data

[For Latin languages, models trained on ~400,000 textlines spanning ~4,500 fonts](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-lstm). [For other scripts, fewer fonts available but similar number of textlines](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-lstm).

# PaddleOCR PP-OCRv5 Architecture

## Pipeline Overview

[PP-OCRv5 employs a four-stage pipeline: image preprocessing, text detection, text line orientation classification, and text recognition](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.05595v1). [System offers both server and mobile variants](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.05595v1).

## Core Stages

### 1. Image Preprocessing
[Handles image rotation and distortion to standardize input](https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleX/3.3/en/pipeline_usage/tutorials/ocr_pipelines/OCR.html)

### 2. Text Detection
[Based on improved DB (Differentiable Binarization) architecture](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-OCRv5_server_det). [Models output probability maps post-processed into polygon bounding boxes](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-OCRv5_server_det).

### 3. Text Line Orientation Classification
[Classifies orientation of detected text for correct alignment](https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleX/3.3/en/pipeline_usage/tutorials/ocr_pipelines/OCR.html)

### 4. Text Recognition
[Uses encoder-decoder architecture with CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss](https://huggingface.co/blog/baidu/ppocrv5). [Supports variable-length text input and outputs character sequences with confidence scores](https://huggingface.co/blog/baidu/ppocrv5).

## Key Innovation

[PP-OCRv5 achieves unified recognition of Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Chinese Pinyin, English, and Japanese in a single model](https://deepwiki.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/2.1-pp-ocrv5-universal-text-recognition). [Previous versions required separate models for different languages](https://huggingface.co/blog/baidu/ppocrv5).

[Single model supports five text types with 13% accuracy improvement](https://www.alphaxiv.org/overview/2507.05595). [Maintains efficiency for both cloud and edge deployment](https://huggingface.co/blog/baidu/ppocrv5).

## Performance Characteristics

- Swift processing, several times faster with GPU
- Optimized for Chinese and English text
- Industrial-grade reliability for invoice processing, ID card recognition


---

# EasyOCR Architecture

## Dual-Architecture Approach

[Languages with complex characters like Chinese/Japanese use attention-based architectures rather than CTC due to large character sets](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/custom_model.md). [Script-specific models: CRNN for Latin, Transformer for CJK](https://medium.com/@mohamed5elyousfi/-277e9c685578).

## Core Components

[Recognition model is CRNN with three main components](https://medium.com/@adityamahajan.work/easyocr-a-comprehensive-guide-5ff1cb850168):

### 1. Feature Extraction
[Deep learning models like ResNet and VGG extract features from input images](https://eng-mhasan.medium.com/ocr-with-deep-learning-in-python-e443970d09e4). [Current configuration: 'None-VGG-BiLSTM-CTC'](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/custom_model.md).

### 2. Sequence Labeling
[LSTM networks interpret extracted features' sequential context](https://products.documentprocessing.com/parser/python/easyocr/)

### 3. Decoding
[CTC algorithm decodes and transcribes labeled sequences into recognized text](https://products.documentprocessing.com/parser/python/easyocr/)

## Text Detection

[CRAFT-based text localization enhanced with ResNet backbone](https://medium.com/@mohamed5elyousfi/-277e9c685578)

## Training Pipeline

[Based on modified version of deep-text-recognition-benchmark framework](https://www.bentoml.com/blog/deploying-an-ocr-model-with-easyocr-and-bentoml)

## CJK-Specific Considerations

The fundamental architectural difference: [CJK scripts with thousands of characters require different model architectures than Latin scripts](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/custom_model.md). This is why EasyOCR uses Transformer models for CJK rather than the CRNN approach used for Latin scripts.

# CJK-Specific Technical Challenges

## Character Set Size

The fundamental architectural difference between Latin and CJK OCR: [CJK scripts with thousands of characters require different model architectures](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/custom_model.md).

**Impact**:
- Attention mechanisms preferred over CTC for CJK
- Larger model sizes required
- More training data needed
- Higher computational requirements

## Multilingual Mixed Documents

[DeepSeek-OCR (2026) focuses on recognizing patterns in visual structure rather than alphabet-specific tokens, allowing seamless handling of multilingual and mixed-script content on a single page](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-does-deepseekocr-enable-multilingual-and-mixedscript-document-processing).

[PaddleOCR has dedicated Chinese+English models reflecting Baidu's focus](https://intuitionlabs.ai/pdfs/technical-analysis-of-modern-non-llm-ocr-engines.pdf). [Engineered for both high accuracy and deployment efficiency, excelling in industrial use cases](https://intuitionlabs.ai/pdfs/technical-analysis-of-modern-non-llm-ocr-engines.pdf).

## Vertical Text Processing

Japanese documents often use vertical writing (tategaki):
- Text flows top to bottom
- Columns progress right to left
- Mixed horizontal inserts require special handling
- Furigana (pronunciation guides) positioned differently

**Solutions**:
- Dedicated vertical text models (jpn_vert in Tesseract)
- Orientation detection and classification
- Layout-aware processing pipelines

## Word Boundary Detection

Chinese and Japanese lack explicit word boundaries:
- Character sequences must be parsed for word breaks
- Context-dependent segmentation required
- Different from Korean which uses spaces

**Impact**: OCR alone insufficient - requires additional word segmentation step for downstream NLP tasks.

# S3 Need-Driven Discovery: OCR for CJK Languages

## Methodology Overview

This analysis evaluates OCR libraries and services for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) text through a **need-driven lens**, matching OCR capabilities to real-world business scenarios and compliance requirements rather than comparing features in isolation.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Use Case Decomposition

Each use case is analyzed across six critical dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions Addressed |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **WHO** | What organizations/roles need this? What industries? |
| **WHY** | What business problem does OCR solve? What's the cost of not solving it? |
| **Document Types** | Structured forms? Handwritten? Mixed languages? Degraded quality? |
| **Accuracy Requirements** | What's acceptable error rate? Which fields are critical? |
| **Volume & Speed** | Pages per day? Real-time vs batch? Processing SLA? |
| **Compliance & Integration** | Data residency? Privacy regulations? Existing systems? |

### 2. Library Capability Mapping

For each use case, libraries and services are evaluated on:

- **Language-specific accuracy**: Performance on CJK characters (printed and handwritten)
- **Layout understanding**: Table extraction, multi-column, vertical text (Japanese)
- **Deployment model**: On-premise vs cloud API, edge deployment capability
- **Cost structure**: Per-page fees vs licensing vs free open-source
- **Integration complexity**: API maturity, framework support, documentation quality

### 3. Decision Criteria Weighting

Different use cases prioritize different factors:

| Use Case Type | Accuracy | Cost | Speed | Compliance | Ease of Use |
|---------------|----------|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Healthcare** | 99%+ ⚠️ | Medium | Medium | CRITICAL (PHI) | Medium |
| **Government** | 99.9%+ ⚠️ | Low (budget) | Low | CRITICAL (data sovereignty) | Low |

# Use Case: Healthcare Records Digitization

## Domain Description

Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare systems manage massive volumes of patient records, prescriptions, and medical reports containing CJK text. Legacy paper records must be digitized for EMR migration, while ongoing documents (handwritten prescriptions, lab reports, patient forms) require OCR for indexing and retrieval. Medical terminology in CJK characters adds complexity beyond general-purpose text recognition.

## Who Needs This

**Primary Users:**
- **Hospitals and medical centers**: Digitizing decades of paper records for EMR transition
- **Health insurance companies**: Processing claims with attached medical documents
- **Telemedicine platforms**: Extracting data from patient-submitted documents
- **Medical records management companies**: BPO providers for healthcare digitization
- **Pharmaceutical companies**: Processing clinical trial data and adverse event reports
- **Government health agencies**: Public health surveillance and reporting

**Geographic Focus:**
- Japan (aging population, massive paper archives)
- China (rapid EMR adoption, insurance digitization)
- South Korea (national health insurance claims processing)
- Taiwan (healthcare sector digitization initiatives)

## Why This Matters

**Business Impact:**
- **Patient safety**: Medication errors from illegible prescriptions kill 7,000+ annually
- **Efficiency**: Clinicians spend 30-40% of time on documentation
- **Compliance**: EMR mandates in many Asian countries (Japan's My Number, China's healthcare big data push)
- **Cost**: Manual chart abstraction costs $15-30 per record

**Pain Points Without OCR:**
- Cannot search legacy records (paper archives or scanned PDFs)
- Duplicate data entry from paper to EMR
- Delayed care due to inaccessible medical history
- Insurance claim rejection due to illegible documentation

## Requirements Analysis

### Document Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Languages** | CJK + medical terminology + English drug names | Mixed language in single document |
| **Handwriting** | 30-50% handwritten content | Prescriptions, clinical notes |
| **Quality** | Variable (faded faxes, thermal paper, carbon copies) | Legacy documents degraded over time |
| **Volume** | 100-100K documents/day | Large hospitals digitize decades of archives |
| **Layout** | Highly structured forms + free-text notes | Mix of checkboxes, tables, narrative text |

**Key Document Types:**
- **Patient registration forms**: Name, ID, address in CJK
- **Prescriptions**: Drug names (often in Japanese katakana or Chinese), dosage, instructions
- **Lab reports**: Test names in CJK, numeric results, reference ranges
- **Medical certificates**: Diagnoses written in medical terminology (kanji/hanja)
- **Insurance claim forms**: Structured data with CJK identifiers
- **Clinical notes**: Mixed handwritten/printed notes

### Accuracy Requirements

| Field Type | Minimum Accuracy | Business Impact if Wrong |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|

| Drug names | 99.5%+ | Medication errors, patient harm |
| Dosage | 99.9%+ | Underdose or overdose risk |
| Diagnoses | 95%+ | Affects insurance coverage, treatment plans |
| Dates | 99%+ | Incorrect treatment timeline |

**Special Considerations:**
- **False positive tolerance**: ZERO for critical fields (patient ID, allergies)
- **Confidence scoring**: Must flag uncertain extractions for manual review
- **Audit trail**: Track all OCR corrections for regulatory compliance

### Processing Mode

- **Batch processing**: Archive digitization (overnight, weekend runs)
- **Near real-time**: Insurance claim submission (`<5` min)
- **Real-time**: Emergency room document scanning (`<30`s for triage)
- **Review workflow**: REQUIRED for all clinical fields before use

### Integration Requirements

- EMR systems (Epic, Cerner, local vendors like Mega-i in Japan)
- PACS (medical imaging) for radiology reports

- South Korea (legal filings, commercial contracts)
- Hong Kong (bilingual contracts: English + Traditional Chinese)
- Taiwan (court documents, legal filings)

## Why This Matters

**Business Impact:**
- **E-discovery**: Litigation review of 100K-10M pages per case
- **Cost**: Manual review costs $50-200/hour for contract attorneys
- **Risk**: Missed clause in contract review can cost millions
- **Time pressure**: Discovery deadlines measured in days/weeks
- **Compliance**: Regulatory audits require searchable archives

**Pain Points Without OCR:**
- Cannot search scanned contracts (must read every page)
- E-discovery takes weeks/months for multi-language documents
- Contract analysis requires bilingual attorneys ($300-500/hour)
- Patent prior art searches miss relevant CJK documents

## Requirements Analysis

### Document Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Languages** | Formal CJK + legal terminology + English clauses | Contracts often bilingual, use archaic/formal terms |
| **Layout** | Multi-column contracts, tables, complex formatting | Legal docs have nested clauses, exhibits, schedules |
| **Quality** | Variable (clean Word docs to degraded faxed exhibits) | Discovery includes 20-year-old documents |
| **Volume** | 1K-10M pages per matter | Major litigation can involve millions of pages |
| **Precision** | Near-perfect accuracy | Misread number in contract = multi-million dollar error |

**Key Document Types:**
- **Contracts**: Sales agreements, NDAs, employment contracts in CJK
- **Court filings**: Complaints, motions, judgments (formal legal language)
- **Patents**: Technical descriptions in CJK with diagrams
- **Regulatory filings**: SEC-equivalent filings in Asian markets
- **Corporate governance**: Board minutes, shareholder resolutions
- **Evidence**: Emails, memos, financial documents in discovery

### Accuracy Requirements

| Field Type | Minimum Accuracy | Business Impact if Wrong |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Monetary amounts | 99.99%+ | Contractual disputes, financial errors |
| Dates (deadlines) | 99.9%+ | Statute of limitations, breach of contract |
| Party names | 99.9%+ | Wrong legal entity, unenforceable contract |
| Legal terminology | 98%+ | Misinterpretation of obligations |
| Patent claims | 99.5%+ | IP scope errors, patent invalidity |

**Special Considerations:**
- **Admissibility**: OCR output may be used as evidence, must meet legal standards
- **Chain of custody**: Audit trail from scan to OCR to review
- **Redaction**: Privilege review requires preserving exact layout
- **Versioning**: Track document versions, changes across redlines

### Processing Mode

- **Batch processing**: Nightly e-discovery processing (100K+ pages)
- **On-demand**: Contract upload and instant search (`<1` min for 50-page contract)
- **Archival**: Legacy document migration (months-long projects)
- **Real-time**: Court recording transcription (live hearings)

### Integration Requirements

- Document management systems (iManage, NetDocuments)
- E-discovery platforms (Relativity, Nuix, Everlaw)
- Contract lifecycle management (CLM) tools (Ironclad, Agiloft)
- Case management systems
- Redaction and privilege review tools
- Translation memory systems (for bilingual documents)

# OCR for CJK Text: Domain Explainer

## What This Solves

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for CJK languages tackles a fundamental problem: converting images of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text into editable, searchable digital text.

**The core challenge**: While Latin-alphabet OCR deals with ~26 letters, CJK OCR must distinguish between potentially **100,000+ ideographic characters**. This isn't just "OCR with more symbols" - it's a qualitatively different problem requiring specialized approaches.

**Who encounters this**:
- Financial institutions processing invoices from Asian suppliers
- Healthcare systems digitizing patient records with mixed English/Chinese text
- Legal firms handling contracts in multiple Asian languages
- Logistics companies processing customs forms across Asia-Pacific
- Government agencies verifying ID cards and official documents
- Manufacturing companies managing supplier documentation from China, Japan, and Korea

**Why it matters**: Without CJK-specific OCR, organizations either resort to expensive manual data entry or risk errors from systems designed for alphabetic languages. A single misread character in a Chinese invoice could mean confusing 万 (10,000) with 方 (direction) - catastrophic for financial processing.

## Accessible Analogies

### The Scale Problem

Imagine organizing a library:
- **Latin OCR**: You have 26 boxes (letters A-Z). Sort books by first letter.
- **CJK OCR**: You have 100,000 boxes. Many look almost identical - like having 50 boxes all labeled "木" but with tiny variations meaning "tree," "wood," "forest," or "lumber."

### The Word Boundary Problem

**Space-delimited languages** (English, Korean): Like items on a shelf with clear dividers between them.

**Non-delimited languages** (Chinese, Japanese): Like items packed tightly in a box with no separators. The OCR system must figure out where one "item" ends and another begins based on context and patterns alone.

### The Multi-Script Challenge

Japanese text mixes three writing systems in one sentence:
- Kanji (complex ideographs borrowed from Chinese)
- Hiragana (phonetic syllabary for grammar)
- Katakana (phonetic syllabary for foreign words)

This is like reading a document that randomly switches between Roman letters, Greek alphabet, and Egyptian hieroglyphics - all in one paragraph. The OCR system must recognize and switch contexts seamlessly.

### The Vertical Text Issue

Japanese documents often write vertically (top to bottom, right to left). Imagine if English alternated between horizontal left-to-right and vertical reading - your OCR system would need to:
1. Detect the orientation
2. Adjust processing pipeline
3. Maintain correct reading order
4. Export results that preserve layout

## When You Need This

### Clear Decision Criteria

**You need CJK-specific OCR if**:
- Processing any documents containing Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text
- Handling multilingual documents mixing CJK and Latin scripts
- Digitizing historical archives from Asian countries
- Automating data entry from government forms, receipts, or invoices in Asian languages
- Building systems for Asia-Pacific operations

**You DON'T need CJK-specific OCR if**:
- Your documents are purely Latin-alphabet languages
- You only process born-digital documents (no scanning)
- Volume is low enough that manual entry is faster
- Your use case is purely English or Western European languages

### Concrete Use Cases

**Financial Services**: Chinese banks use OCR to process checks and ATM transactions. A Western bank opening Asia-Pacific operations needs the same capability to process supplier invoices written in Simplified Chinese.

**Healthcare**: A hospital network with Chinese-speaking patients must digitize handwritten prescription notes that mix English drug names with Chinese dosage instructions.

**Logistics**: A shipping company needs to extract data from bills of lading written in Japanese (vertical text), Chinese (no word spaces), and English (standard horizontal) - all on the same document.

**Identity Verification**: KYC compliance requires extracting data from Chinese national ID cards, Japanese driver's licenses, and Korean resident registration cards - each with different layouts and character sets.

## Trade-offs

### The Core Choice: Open Source vs Commercial

**Open Source** (Tesseract, PaddleOCR, EasyOCR):
- **Pro**: Free, self-hosted, no vendor lock-in
- **Pro**: Full control over data (critical for compliance)
- **Pro**: Can fine-tune models for specific document types
- **Con**: Lower accuracy on complex documents (87-96% vs 99.8%)
- **Con**: Requires ML/CV expertise to optimize
- **Con**: No enterprise SLAs or support
- **Con**: GPU needed for acceptable performance

**Commercial** (ABBYY, Google Cloud Vision, Azure AI):
- **Pro**: 99%+ accuracy, ready to use
- **Pro**: Managed service, no infrastructure
- **Pro**: Enterprise support and SLAs
- **Pro**: Handle complex layouts automatically
- **Con**: Usage-based pricing ($$$)
- **Con**: Vendor lock-in
- **Con**: Data leaves your infrastructure (compliance risk)
- **Con**: Less customization

### Complexity vs Capability Spectrum

**Simple** → **Advanced**:

1. **EasyOCR**: Install, run, get 80+ languages. Best for quick prototypes.
2. **Tesseract**: Mature ecosystem, 100+ languages, moderate setup.
3. **PaddleOCR**: Highest accuracy for CJK, requires GPU and tuning.
4. **Commercial APIs**: Highest accuracy, easiest setup, ongoing costs.
5. **Custom VLM**: Cutting-edge (DeepSeek-OCR, Qwen2-VL), requires advanced ML team.

### Build vs Buy Considerations

**Build (open source) when**:
- Budget < $10K/year
- Data cannot leave your infrastructure (HIPAA, GDPR, national security)
- Processing Chinese documents specifically (PaddleOCR has Baidu's optimization)
- Have GPU infrastructure already
- Volume is predictable

**Buy (commercial) when**:
- Accuracy is non-negotiable (legal, compliance)
- No ML/CV expertise in-house
- Volume is highly variable (pay per use)
- Need results in days, not months
- Multi-region deployment (leverage vendor infrastructure)

### Self-Hosted vs Cloud Services

**Self-hosted** (Tesseract, PaddleOCR on your servers):
- Full data control
- Fixed costs after initial setup
- Requires infrastructure and maintenance
- Scales linearly with volume

**Cloud** (Google Cloud Vision, Azure AI):
- No infrastructure management
- Pay per API call
- Auto-scales to any volume
- Data governance considerations

## Cost Considerations

### Open Source: "Free" But Not Zero

**Infrastructure costs**:
- GPU instance: $300-1000/month (AWS p3.2xlarge ~$3/hr)
- Storage for models: ~10GB per language pack
- Development time: 2-4 weeks for production-ready setup

**Hidden costs**:
- ML engineer salary: $120-200K/year (part-time allocation)
- Model tuning for your specific documents: 40-80 hours
- Maintenance and updates: 10 hours/month

**Break-even**: If processing `<100`K pages/year, commercial APIs often cheaper than managing infrastructure.

### Commercial APIs: Pay Per Use

**Google Cloud Vision OCR**:
- $0-1M units/month: $1.50 per 1,000 units
- 1M-5M units: $1.00 per 1,000
- 5M+ units: $0.60 per 1,000
- (1 unit = 1 page or 1 API call)

**Azure AI Document Intelligence**:
- Free tier: 500 pages/month
- Standard: $0.00125 per page (S0 tier)
- Volume discounts available

**Realistic example**: Processing 50,000 invoices/month:
- Google Cloud Vision: ~$75/month (at $1.50/1K rate)
- Self-hosted PaddleOCR: $300/month GPU + $15K setup + maintenance

**When commercial makes sense**: Variable volume, `<100`K pages/month, need 99%+ accuracy, no ML team.

**When open source makes sense**: `>500`K pages/month, predictable volume, have ML expertise, data sensitivity.

## Implementation Reality

### Realistic Timeline Expectations

**Week 1-2: Evaluation**
- Test sample documents with EasyOCR (easiest start)
- Benchmark accuracy on your specific document types
- Test with PaddleOCR if Chinese documents are primary use case
- Decision point: build vs buy

**If Open Source:**
- **Week 3-4**: Set up infrastructure (GPU instances, model storage)
- **Week 5-8**: Fine-tune for your document types (critical - generic models may only hit 85%)
- **Week 9-12**: Build preprocessing pipeline (deskew, denoise, contrast adjustment)
- **Month 4**: Production deployment, monitoring

**If Commercial:**
- **Week 3**: API integration (typically 2-3 days)
- **Week 4**: Testing and validation
- **Month 2**: Production deployment

### Team Skill Requirements

**Open Source Path**:
- ML Engineer (model tuning, evaluation): 40 hours
- Backend Developer (API integration, pipeline): 60 hours
- DevOps (infrastructure, GPU optimization): 40 hours

**Commercial API Path**:
- Backend Developer (API integration): 20 hours
- No ML expertise required

### Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

**Pitfall 1: "OCR is a solved problem"**
- Reality: Generic OCR hits 70-85% on CJK. Production systems need 95%+.
- Fix: Budget time for document-specific tuning.

**Pitfall 2: "More languages = better for my use case"**
- Reality: Tesseract has 100+ languages but PaddleOCR (80 languages) outperforms on Chinese invoices.
- Fix: Test on YOUR documents, not generic benchmarks.

**Pitfall 3: "Accuracy is the only metric"**
- Reality: Speed, layout preservation, and error types matter.
- Fix: Define success criteria beyond accuracy (e.g., "extract correct total from invoice 99% of time").

**Pitfall 4: "Commercial APIs are always better"**
- Reality: For Chinese documents, PaddleOCR (free) often matches/beats commercial APIs.
- Fix: Run bake-off with real documents before committing.

**Pitfall 5: "Vertical Japanese text is just rotated horizontal"**
- Reality: Reading order, furigana placement, and mixed horizontal inserts require special handling.
- Fix: Use jpn_vert models or verify commercial API handles tategaki correctly.

### First 90 Days: What to Expect

**Month 1: Discovery**
- Collect representative sample documents (100+ pages)
- Test 2-3 solutions on samples
- Discover edge cases (handwriting, stamps, low-quality scans)
- Realize accuracy is lower than hoped

**Month 2: Iteration**
- Implement preprocessing (biggest accuracy gains here)
- Fine-tune models or adjust API parameters
- Build error handling for common failures
- Get to 90% accuracy

**Month 3: Production Hardening**
- Handle remaining 10% edge cases
- Build monitoring and alerting
- Create human review workflow for low-confidence results
- Achieve production-ready 95%+ accuracy

**The 90-10 rule**: 90% accuracy is achievable in weeks. 95%+ takes months of edge case handling.

## Key Insights

1. **CJK OCR is not "OCR with more letters"** - it's a fundamentally different problem requiring specialized approaches for character segmentation, word boundary detection, and multi-script handling.

2. **The Baidu advantage**: For Chinese-heavy workloads, PaddleOCR (open source from Baidu) often outperforms commercial Western APIs despite being free - because it was built by Chinese engineers for Chinese documents.

3. **Preprocessing matters more than model choice**: 80% of accuracy improvements come from proper image preprocessing (deskew, denoise, contrast adjustment) not from choosing the "best" OCR engine.

4. **No single best solution**: The right choice depends on your specific mix of languages, document types, volume, and data governance requirements. Run benchmarks on YOUR documents.

5. **The 95% barrier**: Getting from 90% to 95% accuracy takes as much effort as getting from 0% to 90%. Budget accordingly and decide if human review workflows are cheaper than pursuing that last 5%.
