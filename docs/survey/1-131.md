### Project Characteristics
- **Count**: 10-50 client projects (varying sizes)
- **Isolation**: Clients must NOT see each other's projects
- **Billing**: Time tracking needed for hourly billing
- **Reporting**: Per-client reports for billing/transparency

### Platform Recommendations

#### Primary Option: **OpenProject**
**Why**:
- Strong multi-project hierarchy
- Time tracking built-in (billable hours)
- Cost tracking
- Per-project permissions (client isolation)
- Client can be given read-only access to their project only

**Agency Architecture**:
```
OpenProject Instance
├── Client A
│   ├── Project A1
│   └── Project A2
├── Client B
│   ├── Project B1
│   └── Project B2
└── Internal
    └── Agency Operations
```

**Permissions**:
- Agency staff: See all projects
- Client A: See ONLY Client A projects (read-only or limited)
- Client B: See ONLY Client B projects

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Excellent multi-project + permissions
- ✅ Time tracking for billing
- ✅ Cost reports per client
- ❌ No true multi-tenancy (single instance, permission-based separation)
- ❌ Complex permission setup

#### Alternative Option: **Redmine**
**Why**:
- Mature multi-project hierarchy
- Time tracking plugins
- Billing plugins available
- Can create per-client parent projects

**Trade-offs**:

#### Multi-Tenancy Pattern (Advanced)

If TRUE multi-tenancy needed (separate databases per client):
- Deploy multiple instances of Plane/Taiga/Vikunja (one per client)
- Use Docker containers with separate databases
- More complex infrastructure but TRUE isolation

**When multi-tenancy needed**:
- High-security clients (government, healthcare)
- Data MUST be isolated (not just permission-based)
- Clients demand dedicated instances

**Cost**: Higher (multiple VPS or K8s cluster)

### Decision Criteria

**Choose OpenProject if**:
- Permission-based separation sufficient
- Time tracking for billing critical
- Need per-client reporting

**Choose Redmine if**:
- Rails expertise available
- Need extensive plugins for agency workflows

**Choose multi-tenancy (multiple instances) if**:
- High-security requirements
- True data isolation required (separate DBs)
- Budget allows ($100-500/month for multiple instances)

## Appendix: Pattern Combinations

### Real-World Scenario: Multi-Pattern Teams

Many teams match MULTIPLE patterns. Example:

**Scenario**: 8-person software development agency
- Pattern 3: Multi-project (5 client projects)
- Pattern 4: Dev team (Git integration needed)
- Pattern 8: Agency (client separation)
- Pattern 11: Budget-conscious (`<$500/year`)

**Analysis**:
- Patterns 3, 8 → **OpenProject** (multi-project + agency features)
- Pattern 4 → **Plane** (modern dev team)
- Pattern 11 → **Vikunja** (ultra-budget)

**Trade-off**:
- OpenProject fits Patterns 3, 8 BUT violates Pattern 11 (costs $1,300-2,600/year)
- Vikunja fits Pattern 11 BUT poor for Patterns 3, 8 (limited multi-project)
- Plane middle ground: Fits Pattern 4, moderate for Patterns 3, 8, moderate cost

**Decision**: Prioritize patterns by importance
- If budget is #1 constraint → Vikunja (compromise on multi-project)
- If multi-project is #1 constraint → OpenProject (compromise on budget)
- If modern dev UX is #1 constraint → Plane (compromise on agency features)

### Pattern Priority Framework

1. Identify ALL matching patterns
2. Rank patterns by business criticality
3. Find platform matching top 2-3 patterns
4. Accept trade-offs on lower-priority patterns

**What S3 Provides**:
- Generic decision frameworks (hardware store catalog)
- Parameterized patterns (team size, budget, skills, etc.)
- Platform recommendations BY PATTERN (not by specific user)
- Trade-off analysis for each pattern
- TCO summaries
- Migration guidance

**What S3 Does NOT Provide**:
- Specific recommendations for YOUR projects (that's `applications/` folder)
- Application-specific ROI calculations
- Implementation roadmaps for specific teams
- Migration guides for specific SaaS → self-hosted transitions

**Next Steps**:

1. **For Application-Specific Analysis** → Create `applications/project-management/` with:
   - Analysis of ALL your projects
   - Map your portfolio to patterns from S3
   - Select ONE platform for entire portfolio
   - Implementation roadmap

2. **For S2 Comprehensive Discovery** → Performance benchmarks, detailed feature matrix, security analysis

3. **For S4 Strategic Discovery** → Vendor viability, community health, technology evolution
