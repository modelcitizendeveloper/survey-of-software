# CJK Readability Analysis

## What This Solves

Imagine giving someone a book in a language they're learning. In alphabetic languages like English or Spanish, they can at least attempt every word—sound it out, guess from context, look it up. In Chinese, if they don't know a character, they're completely stuck. They can't sound it out phonetically. They can't even look it up easily without knowing how to write it or the pronunciation.

CJK readability analysis solves this fundamental problem: **determining whether a Chinese learner can actually read a piece of text before they waste time trying**. It takes any Chinese text and answers: "What proficiency level (HSK 1-6, TOCFL levels, etc.) does someone need to understand this?"

This matters to three groups:

1. **Language learning platforms** need to match content to learner levels automatically (you can't have humans reading every article)
2. **Content creators** need to know if they're writing at the right difficulty (textbook authors, simplified news sites)
3. **Learners themselves** want to find materials they can actually read (not too easy, not impossibly hard)

Without automated analysis, these groups resort to manual assessment (expensive, slow) or guess-and-check (frustrating for learners).

## Accessible Analogies

Think of Chinese characters like a massive LEGO collection with 3,000+ unique pieces. Learning Chinese means gradually acquiring these pieces:

- **HSK 1** learner: 300 pieces (can build simple structures)
- **HSK 6** learner: 2,500 pieces (can build complex models)

Now imagine you want to give someone assembly instructions. Before handing them over, you scan the instruction manual: "This design requires 847 different LEGO pieces. Do you have them all?"

That's readability analysis. It looks at the text (the instruction manual), counts which unique characters (LEGO pieces) are needed, and compares against standardized learner levels.

The challenge: Unlike LEGO where you can see which pieces you need, Chinese text doesn't have spaces between words. It's like a bag of attached LEGO pieces you need to separate first. This separation step (called "segmentation") is why Chinese readability analysis is more complex than counting words in English.

**Another angle**: Character frequency works like cooking skills. Common characters (的, 是, 我) are like salt and pepper—used in almost every dish, learned first. Rare characters (辩证法 "dialectics") are like saffron—specialized, learned later. Readability analysis counts how much "saffron" vs "salt" is in a text to determine if a beginner cook can handle the recipe.

## When You Need This

**You definitely need this if:**

- You run a language learning app and want to recommend content automatically ("here are 10 articles at your level")
- You're building a digital library with graded readers and need to categorize thousands of texts
- You create educational materials and want real-time feedback on whether you're writing at the target level
- You manage a news site offering "Easy Chinese" versions and need to validate simplifications

**You probably need this if:**

- You're designing accessibility features for Chinese content (simplified government documents, healthcare info)
- You're researching second-language acquisition and need to control for text difficulty
- You're building translation tools that should simplify for learners, not just translate accurately

**You DON'T need this if:**

- Your users are native speakers (they already know all common characters)
- You're doing general NLP (sentiment analysis, classification) where readability is irrelevant
- You're working with non-Chinese languages (completely different problem—this research doesn't transfer)

**The decision hinges on**: Are you matching content difficulty to learner proficiency at scale? If yes, automate. If it's a one-time task, use free web tools.

## Trade-offs

### Simple vs Sophisticated

**Coverage formula approach** (count characters known at HSK level X):
- ✅ Fast (milliseconds per text)
- ✅ Easy to explain to users ("You know 94% of characters = HSK 3")
- ✅ Works well for learner apps (good enough accuracy)
- ❌ Ignores sentence complexity, discourse structure
- ❌ Assumes all HSK 3 characters are equally difficult (not true)

**Machine learning approach** (82+ linguistic features):
- ✅ More accurate (accounts for sentence structure, vocabulary patterns)
- ✅ Can provide diagnostics ("too many compound sentences for this level")
- ❌ Slower (requires full NLP pipeline: segmentation, parsing, POS tagging)
- ❌ Harder to explain ("the SVM says it's level 5" doesn't help users understand why)
- ❌ Requires training data (labeled textbooks, expert assessments)

Most language learning apps use the simple approach. Publishers and educators use ML when they need fine-grained assessment and can afford the complexity.

### Character-Based vs Word-Based

**Character-based** (HSK lists are characters):
- ✅ Aligns with how learners study (character lists, flashcards)
- ✅ Simpler implementation (no word segmentation needed)
- ❌ Misses vocabulary nuance (knowing 研 + 究 individually doesn't mean you know 研究 "research" as a word)

**Word-based** (TOCFL focuses on vocabulary):
- ✅ Better reflects actual reading comprehension
- ✅ More accurate for intermediate/advanced learners
- ❌ Requires accurate word segmentation (adds complexity, potential errors)
- ❌ Harder to align with learning materials (most resources teach characters, not word lists)

The trend is starting with characters (MVP) and adding word-based analysis for advanced learners.

### Build vs Buy

**Self-hosted** (use open-source libraries, HSK word lists):
- ✅ No recurring costs (just server hosting)
- ✅ Full control over algorithm, customization
- ❌ Initial development time (1-2 weeks for basic version)
- ❌ Maintenance burden (keep HSK lists updated, handle edge cases)

**Commercial API** (Google Cloud NLP, LTP-Cloud):
- ✅ Fast integration (1-2 days)
- ✅ Fully managed (no infrastructure worries)
- ❌ Recurring costs (~$1 per million characters analyzed)
- ❌ Less control (can't customize for your domain)
- ❌ APIs don't specifically support HSK levels (you'd still build that layer)

Break-even point: If you're analyzing more than ~5 million texts per year, self-hosting becomes cheaper.

## Cost Considerations

**Free tier** (web tools like HSK Analyzer):
- Good for manual testing, one-off analysis
- Not for production use (rate limits, no API)

**DIY approach**:
- Development: ~$5K-$10K (1-2 weeks)
- Hosting: $20-50/month for 1M texts/month
- Year 1 total: ~$7K-$12K

**Commercial APIs**:
- Google Cloud NLP: $1 per 1M characters after 5M free tier
- At 50M characters/year: ~$45/year in API costs
- But APIs don't give you HSK levels—you still build that logic yourself
- Better suited if you need multi-language NLP beyond just Chinese readability

**Open-source libraries** (HSK Character Profiler, etc.):
- Integration: $500-$1.5K (1-3 days)
- Hosting: $0 (runs in your app)
- Year 1 total: ~$1K-$2K
- Sweet spot for most language learning apps

**Enterprise/Academic** (CRIE-style ML system):
- Development: $50K-$100K (3-6 months, requires NLP expertise)
- Only makes sense if you need research-grade accuracy and diagnostic features
- For publishers, large educational institutions

The pattern: Start cheap with open-source libraries. Upgrade to custom build if you hit scale or need specific features. Only go commercial API if you're already using those platforms for other NLP tasks.

## Implementation Reality

### First 30 Days

Week 1: Integrate an open-source library (HSK Character Profiler) or build a simple coverage formula. You'll have a working prototype that can say "this text is HSK 3" with ~80% accuracy.

Weeks 2-4: Add caching (texts get analyzed repeatedly), error handling, and tests against sample texts at known levels. Deploy with basic API endpoint.

### What Actually Takes Time

1. **Segmentation edge cases**: Medical terms, internet slang, names—Jieba will mess these up. You'll need custom dictionaries.
2. **HSK 3.0 migration**: New standard takes effect July 2026. You'll maintain two versions during transition (2026-2027).
3. **Threshold tuning**: Is 95% character coverage "readable"? Depends on your users. Expect A/B testing to find the right balance.
4. **Traditional vs Simplified**: Not a 1:1 character mapping. Need separate frequency lists and proper conversion libraries.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Assuming perfect segmentation**: Jieba is ~95% accurate. That 5% error rate cascades into readability errors.
- **Treating all HSK 3 characters as equally difficult**: Frequency and context matter. 的 (most common character) vs 辩证法 (rare academic term).
- **Ignoring idioms**: 成语 (4-character idioms) must be learned as units, not as individual characters.
- **Over-engineering for MVP**: Start with character coverage. Don't build the ML system until you know you need it.

### Team Skills Required

- **Basic version**: One Python developer familiar with pip install and REST APIs (junior level is fine)
- **Production version**: Mid-level developer who can handle caching, error handling, deployment
- **ML version**: NLP engineer or data scientist with experience in text classification, training ML models

Most teams can ship a working readability analyzer in 1-2 weeks without NLP expertise. The sophisticated stuff (CRIE-level) is a multi-month project requiring specialists.

### Realistic Expectations

You'll get 80-90% agreement with human assessors on exact level match, 95%+ within ±1 level. That's good enough for learner apps. If you need research-grade precision, budget for the ML approach and several months of development.

The technology is mature. The tools exist. The main challenge is deciding how much accuracy you need versus how much complexity you can handle.
