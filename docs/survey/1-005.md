## Architecture Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Recommended Patterns:

#### **Enterprise Spatial Data Architecture**:
```sql
-- PostGIS optimized spatial queries
-- Proper spatial indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_locations_geom ON locations USING GIST (geom);

-- Efficient spatial queries
SELECT l.name, l.address,
       ST_Distance(l.geom, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749), 4326)) as distance
FROM locations l
WHERE ST_DWithin(
    l.geom,
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749), 4326)::geography,
    1000  -- 1km radius
)
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 20;

-- Spatial aggregation for analytics
SELECT
    ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Centroid(ST_Union(geom))) as center,
    COUNT(*) as location_count,
    category
FROM locations
WHERE ST_Within(geom, ST_MakeEnvelope(-122.5, 37.7, -122.3, 37.8, 4326))
GROUP BY category;
```

#### **Hybrid Cloud-Local Architecture**:
```python
# Combining cloud services with local spatial processing
import requests
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
import geopandas as gpd

class SpatialService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.google_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

    def geocode_with_fallback(self, address):
        # Primary: Google Maps Geocoding
        try:
            response = requests.get(
                "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json",
                params={"address": address, "key": self.google_api_key}
            )
            if response.json()["status"] == "OK":
                return response.json()["results"][0]
        except:
            pass

        # Fallback: Local geocoding service
        return self.local_geocode(address)

    def spatial_analysis(self, points, analysis_polygon):
        # Use Shapely for local geometric operations
        gdf_points = gpd.GeoDataFrame(points)
        analysis_shape = Polygon(analysis_polygon)

        # Spatial analysis
        points_in_polygon = gdf_points[gdf_points.within(analysis_shape)]
        return {
            "total_points": len(gdf_points),
            "points_in_area": len(points_in_polygon),
            "density": len(points_in_polygon) / analysis_shape.area
        }
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

#### **Inefficient Spatial Queries**:
```sql
-- BAD: No spatial indexing, Cartesian coordinates for distance
SELECT * FROM locations
WHERE SQRT(POW(lat - 37.7749, 2) + POW(lng + 122.4194, 2)) < 0.01;

-- GOOD: Spatial indexing with proper geography
SELECT * FROM locations
WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749), 4326)::geography, 1000);
```

#### **Vendor Lock-in Without Abstraction**:
```python
# BAD: Direct vendor API calls throughout application
def find_nearby(lat, lng):
    return googlemaps.places_nearby(location=(lat, lng), radius=1000)

# GOOD: Abstracted location service
class LocationService:
    def find_nearby(self, lat, lng, radius):
        if self.provider == "google":
            return self._google_nearby(lat, lng, radius)
        elif self.provider == "aws":
            return self._aws_nearby(lat, lng, radius)
        else:
            return self._local_nearby(lat, lng, radius)
```
