# The Great Triangulation: Mapping the Software Landscape

> **Just as the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India mapped an unknown continent over 70 years, we're systematically surveying the software library landscape—one measurement at a time.**

## What Is The Great Triangulation?

In the 19th century, the British undertook an ambitious 70-year project to accurately map the Indian subcontinent. The Great Trigonometrical Survey, documented in John Keay's "The Great Arc," measured systematically—one triangulation point at a time—creating ground truth anyone could verify.

**We're doing the same for software libraries:**

- **Not marketing claims** → Systematic measurement
- **Not blog post opinions** → Rigorous methodology (4PS)
- **Not one-off tutorials** → Replicable research + working implementations
- **Not framework lock-in** → Components you understand and own

Each research piece is a **surveyed triangulation point** on the map of the software landscape.

## What Makes This Different

### NOT: Another Tutorial Site
- Tutorials teach "how to use X"
- **We teach:** "Why X over Y, with measured evidence"

### NOT: Another Code Repository
- Code repos are examples
- **We provide:** Research → wrappers → application blueprints

### NOT: Another Framework
- Frameworks lock you in
- **We give you:** Components you understand and own

### YES: A Surveyed Landscape
- "Here's what we measured"
- "Here's how we measured it"
- "Here's the working implementation"
- **"Replicate as needed"**

## Quality Bar & Limitations

### Investment Per Piece
Each research piece represents deep investigation, analysis, and synthesis using the 4PS methodology—the kind of work you don't do while neck-deep in development. **Now you don't have to.**

### Research-Grade Confidence
**Overall confidence:** 70-80% (directionally strong guidance)
**Not:** Consumer Reports 95%+ certainty

This research provides **strategic direction**, not absolute guarantees:
- S1 Rapid: 70-80% confidence (speed-optimized)
- S2 Comprehensive: 80-90% confidence (depth-optimized)
- S3 Need-Driven: 75-85% confidence (context-specific)
- S4 Strategic: 60-70% confidence (forward-looking analysis)

### Information Decay
**Library ecosystems evolve:**
- Pricing changes
- Feature updates
- Acquisitions
- New entrants
- Vendor pivots

**Estimated accuracy:**
- **At publication:** 70-80%
- **12 months:** 50-70%
- **36 months:** &lt;30%

We aim for **quarterly updates** to major categories, but treat research as **living documents** that guide investigation, not gospel truth.

## Empowerment Through Public Research

### The Vision

**Open source tools are available to everyone now.** Incredible libraries exist for nearly every problem. But which ones work? How do you evaluate them? What are the trade-offs?

**This research bridges that gap:**
- **Research shows** which libraries work (**open, public**)
- **Methodology shows** how to evaluate (**replicable**)
- **Implementations show** how to build (**working code**)
- **Patterns provide** proven approaches (**battle-tested**)

**The goal:** Help organizations DIY solutions they would have paid vendors for before. The map is open. The methodology is transparent. The code is yours.

## The Road Ahead: 70 Years to Map a Continent

The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India took 70 years. We're not mapping a physical continent, but the software landscape is equally vast.

### Current Progress (January 2026)
- **38 triangulation points** measured
- **7 major domains** covered
- **4PS methodology** validated across diverse problems
- **Public research** freely accessible

### The Vision (Multi-Year)
- **100+ triangulation points** across software domains
- **20+ application blueprints** showing complete systems
- **Recognized methodology** for systematic library evaluation
- **Community contributions** expanding the map
- **Self-sustaining** through value delivered

**Accept the timeline:**
- Slow initial growth (no one knows you exist)
- Compound effects emerge over years
- Each triangulation point makes the next easier
- Patterns emerge across measurements

**Year 1:** 40 points, few notice
**Year 2:** 70 points, some attention
**Year 3:** 100 points, momentum builds
**Year 4:** 150 points, undeniable value
**Year 5:** 200 points, the map emerges

**India wasn't mapped in a day. Neither will the software landscape be.**

## Disclaimers

This research is provided "as-is" for informational purposes. While we apply rigorous methodology (4PS), research-grade confidence (~70-80%) is not professional consulting advice. Findings decay as ecosystems evolve. Verify critical decisions with hands-on testing. See individual research pieces for methodology details and confidence levels.

No vendor relationships, sponsorships, or financial incentives influence research findings. Pure systematic measurement.
