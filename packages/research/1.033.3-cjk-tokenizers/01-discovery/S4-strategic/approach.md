# S4: Strategic Selection Approach

## Methodology
Future-focused analysis with 5-10 year outlook. Assesses long-term viability, maintenance health, community sustainability, and strategic risk.

## Time Budget
15 minutes

## Discovery Tools Used
- GitHub commit history and contributor analysis
- Issue resolution speed metrics
- Ecosystem adoption trends
- Corporate backing and governance
- Breaking change frequency
- Community growth patterns

## Selection Criteria
- **Maintenance activity** - Not abandoned, regular updates
- **Community health** - Multiple maintainers (low bus factor)
- **Stability** - Semantic versioning, minimal breaking changes
- **Ecosystem momentum** - Growing vs declining adoption
- **Corporate backing** - Sustainable funding/support
- **Standard status** - Industry standard or niche player?

## Key Questions
1. Will this tokenizer still be viable in 5 years?
2. What's the bus factor (how many maintainers)?
3. Is adoption growing or declining?
4. Are there breaking changes frequently?
5. What's the migration path if we need to switch?
6. Who funds/maintains this long-term?

## Risk Assessment Framework

**Low Risk:**
- Multiple active maintainers
- Strong corporate backing
- Growing ecosystem adoption
- Stable API (rare breaking changes)

**Medium Risk:**
- Small maintainer team (2-3 people)
- Community-driven with some corporate support
- Stable adoption (not growing or shrinking)
- Occasional breaking changes with migration paths

**High Risk:**
- Single maintainer
- No clear funding source
- Declining adoption
- Frequent breaking changes or abandoned

## Time Horizon
**5-year outlook:** Will this choice cause regret by 2030?

## Metrics Tracked
- Commits per month (last 12 months)
- Contributors (active in last 12 months)
- GitHub stars trend (growing/stable/declining)
- Major version releases (breaking change frequency)
- Issue close rate
- Time to first response on issues
