# S1 Rapid Discovery Approach

## Methodology

Speed-focused, ecosystem-driven discovery of LLM agent frameworks following 4PS v1.0 S1 protocol.

**Time Budget:** 10 minutes
**Philosophy:** "Popular libraries exist for a reason"

## Discovery Tools Used

1. **GitHub Metrics**
   - Repository stars and trending
   - Commit activity (last 6 months)
   - Contributor count and engagement

2. **Web Search**
   - Framework comparison articles (2025-2026)
   - Production use case validation
   - Community discussions and adoption trends

3. **Package Registries**
   - PyPI download statistics
   - Version release frequency
   - Maintenance status

4. **Community Signals**
   - Medium/blog post frequency
   - Stack Overflow presence
   - Reddit/HN discussions

## Selection Criteria

**Primary Factors:**
- GitHub stars and growth trend
- Recent activity (commits in last 6 months)
- Production adoption evidence
- Documentation quality
- Active community

**Quick Validation:**
- Does it solve the multi-agent orchestration problem?
- Is it actively maintained?
- Are there real-world deployments?

## Frameworks Evaluated

Based on rapid discovery, identified three leading frameworks:

1. **AutoGen** (Microsoft)
2. **CrewAI**
3. **MetaGPT** (Foundation Agents)

These emerged consistently across:
- Top GitHub stars rankings (50k+ each)
- 2025-2026 framework comparison articles
- Production deployment case studies
- Developer community discussions

## Discovery Process

1. **Initial Search:** "multi-agent frameworks 2026" → identified top 3 consistently mentioned
2. **GitHub Validation:** Confirmed high star counts, recent activity
3. **Production Evidence:** Searched for enterprise deployments and use cases
4. **Community Check:** Verified active development, responsive maintainers

## Confidence Level

**80% confidence** - S1 rapid discovery provides strong signal on ecosystem leaders but limited depth on technical capabilities.

## Next Steps

S2 comprehensive analysis should deep-dive into:
- Performance benchmarks
- Feature comparison matrices
- API design evaluation
- Integration capabilities
