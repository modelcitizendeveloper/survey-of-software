## Quick Take

AutoGen is Microsoft's flagship multi-agent framework with proven enterprise adoption and unique cross-language capabilities. The transition to Microsoft Agent Framework (GA target Q1 2026) signals strategic commitment but introduces migration complexity. Best for teams wanting Microsoft ecosystem integration and long-term enterprise support.

**Migration Note:** Existing AutoGen users should plan for Microsoft Agent Framework migration. New projects should evaluate Agent Framework first.
