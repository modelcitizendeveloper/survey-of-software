summary: |
  Comprehensive research into Python cryptographic libraries for secure application
  development. Research covers library ecosystems, security audits, FIPS compliance,
  use case patterns, and practical selection criteria for cryptographic operations.
  All four MPSE methodologies (S1-S4) converged on 'cryptography' as primary recommendation.

key_findings:
  - "cryptography library: 82M+ weekly downloads, industry de facto standard, only FIPS-compliant Python-native option"
  - "All 4 methodologies (S1 rapid, S2 comprehensive, S3 need-driven, S4 strategic) converged on cryptography as primary recommendation"
  - "PyNaCl: Excellent for modern applications without FIPS requirements, cleanest API, zero CVEs, but no FIPS compliance path"
  - "pycryptodome: Solo maintainer risk, high strategic abandonment probability (50-60% within 5 years), not recommended despite good current maintenance"
  - "hashlib: Excellent for hashing-only use cases (stdlib guarantee), but insufficient alone for encryption/signatures"
  - "FIPS compliance is critical differentiator: Only cryptography (via OpenSSL FIPS module) can achieve FIPS 140-2/140-3 validation"
  - "Post-quantum cryptography transition (2030-2035): Only organizationally-backed libraries (cryptography, hashlib) likely to successfully navigate PQC migration"
  - "10-year TCO analysis: cryptography ($145K) vs pycryptodome ($295K) - governance model predicts viability better than current code quality"

notes: |
  This is Tier 1 research focused on building foundational knowledge about
  Python cryptographic libraries. Research is application-neutral and organized
  by security requirements and cryptographic primitives. This is security-critical
  research where wrong library choices can lead to vulnerabilities.
