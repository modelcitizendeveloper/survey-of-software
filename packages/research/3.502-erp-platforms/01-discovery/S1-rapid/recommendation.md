**Platforms Evaluated**: 6 major ERPs (NetSuite, Dynamics 365 BC, SAP Business One, Odoo, Acumatica, Oracle ERP Cloud)
**Decision Time**: Use this guide to select an ERP in under 30 minutes

---

## Quick Decision Tree

### Step 1: What's your company size (revenue)?

**< $5M revenue** → Skip ERP, use accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) [See 3.006 Accounting Software]

**$5M-$50M revenue** → Consider ERP (proceed to Step 2)

**$50M-$500M revenue** → Strong ERP candidate (proceed to Step 2)

**$500M+ revenue** → Enterprise ERP required → **Oracle ERP Cloud** or **SAP S/4HANA**

---

### Step 2: What's your primary business type?

#### **A. Manufacturing (Discrete or Process)**

**Light Manufacturing** (assembly, kitting):
- Budget >$150K/year: **NetSuite** (good) or **Dynamics 365 BC** (better value)
- Budget $50-$150K/year: **Dynamics 365 BC** ⭐ (Best choice)
- Budget <$50K/year: **Odoo Enterprise** (flexible)

**Heavy Manufacturing** (complex MRP, shop floor, quality):
- Budget >$100K/year: **SAP Business One** ⭐ (Best manufacturing)
- Budget $50-$100K/year: **Dynamics 365 BC Premium** (good value)
- Budget <$50K/year: **Odoo Enterprise** (customizable)

---

#### **B. Distribution / Wholesale**

## Migration Triggers: When to Move from Accounting to ERP

### You Need ERP When:

✅ **Multi-location inventory**: Need real-time inventory across warehouses
✅ **Manufacturing**: Need BOMs, work orders, MRP
✅ **Complex order management**: Drop-ship, back-orders, advanced fulfillment
✅ **Project accounting**: Need time tracking, billing, project profitability
✅ **Multi-entity**: Operating multiple legal entities needing consolidation
✅ **Integration pain**: Accounting + CRM + Inventory don't talk to each other
✅ **Scaling challenges**: QuickBooks/Xero hitting user or transaction limits
✅ **Compliance needs**: SOX, industry-specific audit requirements

### Typical Graduation Path:

1. **$0-$1M revenue**: QuickBooks Online, Xero [3.006]
2. **$1M-$5M revenue**: QuickBooks Enterprise, Xero + add-ons [3.006]
3. **$5M-$10M revenue**: Consider ERP (Odoo, Dynamics BC)
4. **$10M-$50M revenue**: ERP strongly recommended
5. **$50M-$500M revenue**: ERP required (NetSuite, Dynamics, SAP B1, Acumatica)
6. **$500M+ revenue**: Enterprise ERP (Oracle ERP Cloud, SAP S/4HANA)

**Note**: These are guidelines. Complexity matters more than revenue alone.

## The "Safe Choice" by Company Size

### **10-50 employees, $5M-$25M revenue**
→ **Dynamics 365 Business Central** ⭐
- Reason: Best value, proven, strong support, scalable

### **50-150 employees, $25M-$100M revenue**
→ **NetSuite** ⭐ (if SaaS/e-commerce/global)
→ **Acumatica** ⭐ (if distribution/construction/many users)
→ **Dynamics 365 BC** ⭐ (if Microsoft ecosystem/best value)

### **150-500 employees, $100M-$500M revenue**
→ **NetSuite** ⭐ (proven, scalable)
→ **Acumatica** (if distribution/construction)

### **500+ employees, $500M+ revenue**
→ **Oracle ERP Cloud** or **SAP S/4HANA**

---

- ❌ Some localizations weaker than NetSuite

### **SAP Business One**
- ✅ Best manufacturing, SAP ecosystem, global localization
- ⚠️ Dated UI, expensive, complex
- ❌ Cloud version less mature

### **Odoo**
- ✅ Cheapest (10x less than NetSuite), flexible, e-commerce, open source

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake 1: Choosing enterprise ERP for mid-market**
- Don't buy Oracle ERP Cloud if you're <$500M revenue
- Don't buy NetSuite if Dynamics BC would suffice

### ❌ **Mistake 2: Underestimating implementation cost**
- Budget 50-100% of annual software cost for implementation
- NetSuite: $50K-$200K implementation
- Dynamics BC: $15K-$75K implementation

### ❌ **Mistake 3: Ignoring total cost of ownership (TCO)**
- Year 1: Software + implementation + training + customization
- Year 2-5: Software + support + upgrades + additional users/modules
- Compare 5-year TCO, not just Year 1

### ❌ **Mistake 4: Choosing based on features alone**
- Fit matters more than features
- "Can it do X?" is less important than "Does it fit our workflow?"

### ❌ **Mistake 5: Skipping reference checks**
- Talk to 3-5 companies in your industry using the ERP
- Ask about implementation pain, hidden costs, support quality

### ❌ **Mistake 6: Not involving key users**
- Include accounting, operations, warehouse, sales in evaluation
- User adoption is critical for ERP success
