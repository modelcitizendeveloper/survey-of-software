- Offshore dev teams for customization (50-70% savings)

### 4. Minimize Customization
- Use out-of-box features whenever possible
- Customize workflows, not core code
- Plan for future upgrades (avoid heavy custom code)

### 5. Consider Open Source (Odoo Community)
- Self-host for maximum savings ($10K-$30K/year)
