## 1. Overview

Fathom is a free AI meeting assistant that provides unlimited recording, transcription, and storage with no time restrictions - a rarity in the meeting assistant market. The platform automatically joins Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams calls to capture audio and video, generate transcripts, and deliver AI-generated summaries within 30 seconds of meeting completion.

Fathom distinguishes itself through an exceptionally generous free tier and product-led growth strategy. While competitors gate features and storage behind paid plans, Fathom offers genuinely unlimited free recording and transcription in 28 languages, making it accessible to individuals, freelancers, and small teams. The platform uses GPT-4 for advanced AI summaries on the free plan (first 5 calls/month) and maintains 95% transcription accuracy.

Fathom targets individual users, small teams, and Zoom-native organizations who prioritize simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness over deep CRM integrations or complex analytics. The platform has built a strong following through word-of-mouth and a smart Zoom-first strategy, later expanding to Google Meet and Microsoft Teams.
