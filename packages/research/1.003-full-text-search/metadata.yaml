# Notes
notes: |
  S1 completed successfully with clear performance winner (Tantivy).
  240× query speed difference makes choice unambiguous for production use.
  Pre-built wheels (3.9MB) make installation as easy as pure Python option.

  Next steps: S2 comprehensive discovery focusing on Tantivy scale testing,
  advanced features (fuzzy, facets), and integration patterns.

  Strategic positioning: Provides DIY baseline for Path 1 vs Path 3 decision
  (self-hosted libraries vs managed services from 3.043).
