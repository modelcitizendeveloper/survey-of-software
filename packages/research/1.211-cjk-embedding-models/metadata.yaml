  Comprehensive analysis of embedding models for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK)
  languages. Covers Chinese-specific models (M3E, text2vec-chinese), multilingual
  models (multilingual-e5, LaBSE), and the sentence-transformers framework for
  deployment. Includes semantic search, cross-lingual retrieval, fine-tuning strategies,
  and production deployment considerations.

  Completed February 6, 2026. Comprehensive analysis of CJK embedding models across
  Chinese-specific (M3E, text2vec-chinese) and multilingual models (multilingual-e5,
  LaBSE), plus sentence-transformers framework for production deployment.

  Key strategic insight: Multilingual models (multilingual-e5) are safer default
  despite 2-5 point Chinese performance penalty - adding Japanese/Korean to Chinese-
  only model later requires full corpus re-embedding (1-2 weeks + risk). Chinese-only
  (M3E) justified only with high certainty of permanent Chinese-only requirement.

  Critical finding: Fine-tuning ROI is 500-20,000% across all use cases (e-commerce,
  support, enterprise). This contradicts common assumption that off-the-shelf models
  are "good enough" - fine-tuning on just 50-100K domain examples delivers 10-20%
  improvement for $50-500 cost. Highest-ROI investment in embedding deployments.

  Break-even analysis: Self-hosting breaks even at ~1M queries/month vs commercial
  APIs. BUT self-hosting enables fine-tuning (only available self-hosted), which
  delivers massive ROI. Therefore, self-hosting is justified even at lower volumes
  when fine-tuning value is factored in.

  Practical impact: Research provides concrete guidance for five major use cases
  (e-commerce, customer support, knowledge base, mobile apps, cross-lingual research)
  with specific model recommendations, deployment patterns, and ROI expectations.
  sentence-transformers identified as industry-standard framework (like HTTP for
  embeddings), enabling ONNX optimization (1.3-1.5x speedup) and quantization (2x
  speedup) for production.

  Strategic paths framework (Chinese-Only, Multilingual, Hybrid) enables organizations
  to choose approach based on language certainty and risk tolerance, rather than
  one-size-fits-all recommendation.

  Long-term trends: Fine-tuning will become standard practice (currently underutilized
  despite massive ROI), commercial APIs will add fine-tuning support (Cohere 2024-25),
  and specialized hardware (AI accelerators) will reduce self-hosting costs 2-3x by
  2027-2030. Open-source models (M3E, multilingual-e5) will remain competitive with
  commercial offerings due to rapid research progress and community fine-tuning.

  Implementation reality: 2-week prototype (sentence-transformers + pre-trained model),
  6-8 week production launch (vector DB + autoscaling), 3-4 month optimization (fine-
  tuning + ONNX + quantization). Most organizations underestimate fine-tuning value
  and skip it - biggest missed opportunity.
