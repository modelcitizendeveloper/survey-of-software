# S3 Need-Driven Pass: Practical Implementation

## Objective
Focus on practical implementation details, programmatic handling, and specific technical needs for developers and organizations implementing TM-based workflows.

## Focus Areas

1. **Programmatic TMX Handling**
   - Python/JavaScript libraries for TMX parsing
   - Generating TMX files programmatically
   - TMX validation and quality checking

2. **TM Alignment Tools**
   - Creating TM from existing translations
   - Sentence alignment algorithms
   - Bitext2tmx, LF Aligner, and other tools

3. **TM Quality Management**
   - TM cleaning and deduplication
   - Quality metrics and scoring
   - Identifying poor-quality segments

4. **MT + TM Hybrid Workflows**
   - Combining machine translation with TM
   - Threshold strategies (when to use MT vs. TM)
   - Post-editing vs. TM matching

5. **Continuous Localization Integration**
   - XLIFF in CI/CD pipelines
   - Git workflows for translation files
   - Automated extraction and merging

6. **TM APIs and Services**
   - Cloud TM storage options
   - Real-time TM lookup APIs
   - Building custom TM services

## Target Deliverables
- Code examples and libraries
- Practical workflow patterns
- Tool recommendations for specific use cases
- Integration patterns

## Time Budget
~45 minutes per topic, focused on actionable information
