# GTD Methodology Alignment Analysis

**How Well Does Each Tool Support Getting Things Done?**

**Reference:** David Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) methodology

---

## GTD Methodology Overview

**The Five Steps:**
1. **Capture:** Collect what has your attention
2. **Clarify:** Process what it means
3. **Organize:** Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect:** Review frequently
5. **Engage:** Simply do

**Key GTD Concepts:**
- Inbox (capture everything)
- Next Actions (very next physical action)
- Projects (outcomes requiring >1 action)
- Contexts (@home, @computer, @phone, @errands)
- Waiting For (delegated items)
- Someday/Maybe (future possibilities)
- Weekly Review (critical habit)
- Calendar (hard commitments only)
- Reference (support material)

## 1. Todoist - GTD Alignment

### Official GTD Status
✅ **Officially Endorsed** - David Allen Company has created a setup guide for Todoist

### GTD Strengths

**Excellent Capture:**
- Quick add everywhere (mobile, desktop, browser extension)
- Natural language: "send invoice Friday at 3pm"
- Email forwarding to inbox
- Voice capture via Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant
- Browser clipper
- **Rating: 9/10**

**Good Clarify:**
- Easy to assign project, priority, labels, due date
- Comments for details
- Natural language reduces friction
- **Rating: 8/10**

**Strong Organize:**
- Projects (up to 300 on Pro)
- Labels = Contexts (@home, @work, etc.)
- Filters = Custom views
- Can create separate projects for:
  - Next Actions
  - Waiting For
  - Someday/Maybe
- **Rating: 8/10**

**Weak Reflect:**
- ❌ No dedicated review mode
- ❌ No review intervals
- Productivity trends show completion stats but not GTD-focused
- Must manually review projects
- **Rating: 5/10**

**Excellent Engage:**
- Today view
- Filters for custom Next Actions views
- Priority levels (P1-P4)
- Natural language makes adding new actions fast
- **Rating: 9/10**

### GTD Weaknesses

1. **No Review Mode:** Biggest gap - GTD's Weekly Review is critical
2. **No Defer Dates:** Can't hide tasks until ready (must use due dates or filters)
3. **Free Tier Insufficient:** Only 5 projects makes GTD impossible
4. **Requires Setup:** Need to create filters, label system, project structure

### GTD Workarounds

**Weekly Review:**
- Create recurring task "Weekly Review"
- Manually review each project
- Use filters to surface stale items

**Defer Dates:**
- Use due dates conservatively
- Create filter for "No date" to find Next Actions
- Use labels like @next_week to defer

**Someday/Maybe:**
- Create "Someday/Maybe" project
- Or use label @someday

### Overall GTD Rating: 8/10

**Excellent for:**
- Capture (best in class with natural language)
- Organization (labels + filters flexible)
- Engagement (Today view + filters)

**Missing:**
- Review mode (must do manually)
- Defer dates (can workaround)

**Best For:** GTD practitioners who want cross-platform, fast capture, and don't mind manual weekly review

## 2. Things 3 - GTD Alignment

### Official GTD Status
✓ **Community Endorsed** - Not officially GTD-certified but widely used by GTD practitioners

### GTD Strengths

**Excellent Capture:**
- Quick Entry (keyboard shortcut everywhere)
- Inbox is prominent
- Natural language for dates
- Share sheet on iOS
- **Rating: 9/10**

**Excellent Clarify:**
- Easy to assign to project, area, tags, dates
- **Unique: "When" vs "Deadline"** - aligns perfectly with GTD's distinction between "next action date" and "hard deadline"
- Notes for details
- **Rating: 9/10**

**Excellent Organize:**
- **Inbox:** Dedicated inbox view
- **Projects:** Unlimited projects
- **Areas:** GTD's "Areas of Responsibility"
- **Tags:** Perfect for contexts (@home, @work, etc.)
- **Anytime:** Next Actions list
- **Upcoming:** Timeline view (Calendar + defer dates)
- **Someday:** Dedicated Someday/Maybe list
- **Headings:** Organize within projects
- **Rating: 9/10**

**Weak Reflect:**
- ❌ No dedicated review mode
- ❌ No review intervals
- ❌ No "last reviewed" dates
- Can use Logbook to see completed items
- **Rating: 5/10**

**Excellent Engage:**
- **Today:** Clear focus on today's actions
- **Anytime:** All available Next Actions
- Tags for context-based work
- Beautiful, distraction-free interface
- **Rating: 9/10**

### GTD Unique Advantage

**When vs Deadline (Do Date vs Due Date):**

Things 3 is the ONLY tool that explicitly separates:
- **When:** When you plan to START working on it (GTD: next action timing)
- **Deadline:** When it must be DONE (GTD: hard deadline)

This matches GTD philosophy perfectly - very few things have true deadlines, but many have planned start dates.

### GTD Weaknesses

1. **No Review Mode:** Like Todoist, missing dedicated GTD review
2. **Apple Only:** Can't use on Windows/Android
3. **No Natural Language:** Less sophisticated than Todoist for dates

### GTD Workarounds

**Weekly Review:**
- Create recurring task "Weekly Review" in Today
- Review each Area and Project manually
- Use Upcoming view to see timeline

**Contexts:**
- Use Tags for @home, @work, @computer, @errands, @phone
- Quick filter by tag

### Overall GTD Rating: 9/10

**Excellent for:**
- Organization (best GTD structure of any tool)
- When/Deadline distinction (unique)
- Clean, focused UX
- Apple ecosystem integration

**Missing:**
- Review mode (must do manually)
- Cross-platform (Apple only)

**Best For:** Apple users who want the cleanest, most GTD-aligned structure without complexity

## GTD Methodology Gaps

### Missing from ALL Platforms

1. **Automatic Context Detection**

   - Device-based: Show @computer when at laptop

2. **Energy-Aware Scheduling**
   - Track when you have high/low energy
   - Suggest high-energy tasks during peak times

3. **GTD Coach/Assistant**
   - Prompt for Weekly Review if overdue
   - Suggest Next Actions based on context/time/energy
   - Detect stuck projects (no progress in X days)

4. **Collaborative GTD**
   - Share "Waiting For" items with teammates
   - Delegation tracking

### Missing from MOST Platforms

- **Review Mode:** Only OmniFocus has this
- **Defer/Start Dates:** Things 3, OmniFocus, Notion, Obsidian support; Todoist does not
- **When vs Due:** Only Things 3 explicitly separates
- **Natural Language:** Only Todoist has sophisticated NLP
