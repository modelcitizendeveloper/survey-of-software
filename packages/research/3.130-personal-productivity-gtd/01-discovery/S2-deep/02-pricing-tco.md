## 3. Hidden Costs Analysis

### Sync & Storage Costs

| Platform | Sync Included? | Storage | Additional Cost | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Todoist** | ✅ Yes | Cloud | $0 | Included in subscription |
| **Things 3** | ✅ Yes | iCloud | $0 | Uses iCloud (already paid?) |
| **OmniFocus** | ✅ Yes | Cloud | $0 | Included |
| **Notion** | ✅ Yes | Cloud | $0 | Included |
| **Obsidian** | ⚠️ Optional | Local | $0 or $96/yr | DIY (free) or Official Sync ($8/mo) |

**Free Sync Options (DIY):**

- Google Drive: Free (15GB) or $1.99/mo (100GB)

### iCloud Storage Consideration

If using iCloud sync (Things 3, Bear):
- iCloud Free: 5GB (probably sufficient for tasks)

**For most users:** 5GB free iCloud is sufficient for task management data.

**Switching from Windows/Android to Mac/iPhone:**
- MacBook Air: $1,099+
- iPhone: $799+
- **Total:** $1,898+ (to access Things 3, OmniFocus, Bear)

## 7. Hidden Costs & Risk Factors

### Switching Costs

**Data Migration Effort:**
| From → To | Difficulty | Time | Data Loss Risk |
|-----------|-----------|------|----------------|
| Todoist → Things 3 | Medium | 4-8 hours | Medium (no direct import) |
| Things 3 → Todoist | Medium | 4-8 hours | Medium (export limited) |
| Any → Obsidian | Low | 2-4 hours | Low (markdown flexible) |
| Obsidian → Any | Low | 2-4 hours | Low (plain text) |
| Notion → Any | Medium | 6-10 hours | Medium (database structure) |

**Lock-In Risk:**
- **High:** Todoist, OmniFocus (proprietary formats, cloud-dependent)
- **Medium:** Things 3, Notion, Bear (export possible but limited)
- **Low:** Obsidian (plain markdown files, easily portable)

### Subscription Fatigue

**Ongoing Subscriptions (Typical User):**
- Netflix: $15/month
- Spotify: $11/month
- iCloud+: $0.99/month
- Dropbox: $11.99/month
- **+ Todoist Pro:** $4/month
- **+ Notion Plus:** $8/month
- **+ OmniFocus:** $10/month

**Total with productivity tools:** $50-60/month = $600-720/year

**Psychological Cost:** Each subscription adds to "subscription fatigue" and mental burden.

**One-Time Purchase Appeal:** Things 3's "$80 forever" feels liberating vs ongoing subscriptions.

### Price Increase Risk

**Historical Price Changes:**
- **Todoist:** Increased from $3/month to $4/month in 2023
- **OmniFocus:** Introduced subscription model (previously one-time only)
- **Notion:** Maintained pricing (so far)

**Risk Assessment:**
| Platform | Price Increase Risk | Grandfathering Policy |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Todoist** | Medium | No (existing users pay new price) |
| **OmniFocus** | Low | Maintained old perpetual licenses |
| **Notion** | Medium | Unknown |
| **Things 3** | N/A | One-time (no future increases) |
| **Obsidian** | Low | Free users protected, sync users unclear |
| **Bear** | Low | Minimal increases historically |

### Opportunity Cost

**Time Investment Required:**
| Platform | Setup Time | Learning Curve | Ongoing Maintenance | Total Year 1 |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Todoist** | 0.5 hours | 1 hour | 5 min/month | ~2 hours |
| **Things 3** | 1 hour | 2 hours | 10 min/month | ~5 hours |
| **OmniFocus** | 2 hours | 8 hours | 30 min/month | ~16 hours |
| **Notion** | 2 hours | 6 hours | 20 min/month | ~12 hours |
| **Obsidian** | 3 hours | 10 hours | 30 min/month | ~19 hours |
| **Bear** | 0.5 hours | 0.5 hours | 0 | ~1 hour (but not GTD) |

**At $50/hour consulting rate:**
- Todoist: $100 time cost + $48 subscription = **$148 Year 1**
- Things 3: $250 time cost + $80 purchase = **$330 Year 1**
- OmniFocus: $800 time cost + $100 subscription = **$900 Year 1**
- Obsidian: $950 time cost + $0 = **$950 Year 1**

**Conclusion:** Simplicity has value. Todoist's low learning curve may save $600-800 in time vs complex tools.

## 8. ROI Calculation

### Productivity Gains

**Assumptions:**
- Average knowledge worker: $75,000/year salary = ~$36/hour
- GTD methodology saves 10% of time (conservative estimate from research)
- Work week: 40 hours
- Annual productive hours: 2,000 hours

**Annual Productivity Value:**
- Time saved: 2,000 × 10% = 200 hours
- Value of time saved: 200 × $36 = **$7,200/year**

### ROI by Platform

| Platform | Annual Cost | Value Gained | ROI | Break-Even |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----|------------|
| **Obsidian** | $0 | $7,200 | ∞ | Instant |
| **Things 3** | $16 (amortized) | $7,200 | 45,000% | Instant |
| **Todoist** | $48 | $7,200 | 14,900% | 2.4 days of work |
| **Notion Plus** | $96 | $7,200 | 7,400% | 4.8 days of work |
| **OmniFocus** | $100 | $7,200 | 7,100% | 5 days of work |

**Conclusion:** ALL GTD tools pay for themselves in less than a week if they deliver promised productivity gains.

**Real Decision Factor:** Price difference ($0-$100/year) is negligible compared to productivity value ($7,200/year). Choose based on **features, UX, and platform compatibility**, not price.

## Conclusion: Best Value Picks

### Best Overall Value
**Obsidian (free)** or **Things 3 ($80 one-time)**
- Obsidian: Free forever, no lock-in, full features
- Things 3: Minimal lifetime cost, no subscription, beautiful UX

### Best Subscription Value
**Todoist Pro ($48/year)**
- Cheapest subscription with full GTD features
- Cross-platform (works everywhere)
- AI features (only option in 2025)
- 2× cheaper than competitors

### Worst Value
**Bear ($15/year)** - not because expensive, but because it's not a GTD tool

### Premium Justified?
**OmniFocus ($100/year)** only if you:
- Need maximum GTD power (perspectives, review mode)
- Are committed GTD expert
- Comfortable with complexity
- Value worth 2× Todoist price

Otherwise, save $52/year and use Todoist Pro.

### Free vs Paid Decision

**Choose Free (Obsidian/Notion) if:**
- Budget-constrained
- Value data ownership/portability
- Willing to invest setup time
- Comfortable with technical tools

**Choose Paid if:**
- Want ready-to-go GTD ($48-100/year is negligible vs productivity value)
- Prefer polish and simplicity
- Need AI features (Todoist)
- Want Apple ecosystem integration (Things 3)

**Bottom Line:** Price difference ($0-$100/year) is **irrelevant** compared to productivity value ($7,200+/year). Choose the tool you'll actually use consistently.
