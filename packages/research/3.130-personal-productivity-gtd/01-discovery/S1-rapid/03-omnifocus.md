## GTD Implementation Verdict

**Rating: Exceptional for Power Users (10/10), Challenging for Beginners (6/10)**

OmniFocus is the most comprehensive GTD implementation available. If you're deeply committed to GTD methodology and need every advanced feature, this is the gold standard. The combination of custom perspectives, review mode, and flexible organization provides unmatched GTD power.

However, this power comes at a cost: complexity and price. The learning curve is steep, and casual users will be overwhelmed. This is a tool for GTD practitioners who have read David Allen's book, understand the methodology, and want software that matches their discipline.

**Best For:**
- Committed GTD practitioners
- Power users comfortable with complexity
- Apple ecosystem users
- Professionals managing high task volume
- Users who need custom perspectives and advanced filtering
- Those willing to invest time learning the system
- Users who value GTD Weekly Review discipline

**Not Ideal For:**
- GTD beginners or casual users
- Budget-conscious users ($99.99/year is expensive)
- Cross-platform users needing Windows/Android
- Users wanting simplicity and ease of use
- Teams (individual-focused tool)
- Users expecting AI assistance or modern smart features
- People seeking "quick start" productivity tool

## Competitive Position

OmniFocus is the **most powerful but least approachable** GTD tool:

- **vs Todoist:** More powerful but more complex; Apple-focused vs cross-platform; 2.5× more expensive
- **vs Things 3:** More powerful but harder to learn; similar Apple ecosystem; comparable pricing (OmniFocus $99/year vs Things 3 $80 one-time)
- **vs Notion:** Dedicated GTD tool vs flexible workspace; better for strict GTD, worse for hybrid workflows
- **vs Obsidian:** Proprietary vs open; better task management UX, less flexible overall

**Target User:** GTD expert on Apple devices who needs maximum power and control, willing to invest time and money for the most comprehensive GTD implementation.

**Market Position:** Premium power-user tier - small but dedicated user base willing to pay for advanced GTD features.
