**Deliverables**:
1. **Feature matrix**: 50+ features across 6 platforms (detailed comparison)
2. **Pricing analysis**: TCO over 1, 3, 5 years (team size scenarios: 5, 10, 20, 50 users)
3. **Integrations ecosystem**: Integration depth, API quality, Zapier maturity
4. **Permission models**: Team collaboration patterns, role-based access control
5. **Mobile experience**: iOS/Android feature parity, offline capabilities
6. **Synthesis**: Cross-cutting insights, decision frameworks

## Pricing Analysis Structure

### Scenarios (4 Team Sizes)

**Scenario 1: Small team (5 users)**
- Free plan capabilities
- Minimum paid plan cost
- Features unlocked
- 1-year, 3-year, 5-year TCO

**Scenario 2: Growing team (10 users)**
- Recommended plan
- Monthly/annual cost
- 3-year, 5-year TCO
- Feature trade-offs

**Scenario 3: Mid-size team (20 users)**
- Recommended plan (likely Business/Pro tier)
- Advanced features needed
- 3-year, 5-year TCO
- Per-user economics

**Scenario 4: Larger team (50 users)**
- Enterprise plan triggers
- Volume discounts (if any)
- 3-year, 5-year TCO
- Hidden costs (support, training)

### Cost Components

**Visible costs**:
- Base subscription (per user per month)
- AI add-ons (ClickUp Brain, Airtable AI)
- Storage overages
- Integration add-ons

**Hidden costs**:
- Training time (learning curve × team size × hourly rate)
- Migration costs (data import, workflow setup)
- Support costs (priority support tier differences)
- Opportunity cost (lost productivity during onboarding)

## Integration Ecosystem Structure

### Integration Depth Analysis

**For each platform**:
1. **Native integrations count** (e.g., Asana 200+, Linear 20)
2. **Top 10 integrations** (Slack, Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. **Integration quality tiers**:
   - Tier 1: Deep native integration (bidirectional, real-time)
   - Tier 2: Basic native integration (one-way, polling)
   - Tier 3: Via Zapier/API only

**Key integrations to evaluate**:
- Slack (create, update, notifications, bidirectional)
- Email (create from email, notifications, reply-to-update)
- Google Workspace (Drive, Calendar, Gmail)
- GitHub/GitLab (code integration, close from commits)
- Zoom (meeting recordings, transcripts)
- Salesforce (CRM sync)
- Zapier (ecosystem breadth)

### API Quality Assessment

**Evaluation criteria**:
- API type (REST, GraphQL)
- Documentation quality
- Rate limits
- Webhook support
- SDK availability (official/community)
- API stability (versioning, deprecation policy)

---

## Permission Models Structure

### Role Types

**For each platform**:
1. Available roles (Guest, Viewer, Member, Admin, Owner)
2. Permissions per role
3. Granularity (workspace, project, board, task level)
4. Custom roles (available on which plans?)

### Collaboration Patterns

**Team scenarios**:
1. **External collaborators** (clients, contractors): Guest access, limitations
2. **Cross-functional teams** (marketing + eng): Permission boundaries
3. **Large organizations** (multiple teams): Workspace/org structure
4. **Security-sensitive** (finance, legal): Field-level permissions, audit logs

---

## Mobile Experience Structure

### Feature Parity

**For each platform (iOS/Android)**:
1. Core features available on mobile
2. Features missing vs desktop
3. Offline mode capabilities
4. Push notification quality
5. Voice input (if available)
6. Speed/performance

### User Experience

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Onboarding flow (mobile-first or desktop-assumed?)
- Navigation patterns (tabs, gestures, search)
- Task creation speed (# of taps)
- Notification management (customization, batching)

---

## Synthesis Structure

### Decision Frameworks

**Output**:
1. **Feature requirement checklist**: "If you need X feature, platforms Y, Z support it"
2. **Pricing decision tree**: "For N users with budget $X, choose platform Y"
3. **Integration necessity matrix**: "If you use Slack + GitHub, Linear/Asana are best"
4. **Permission complexity ladder**: "Simple → Complex permission needs = Trello → Asana → Airtable"

### Cross-Cutting Insights

**Themes to identify**:
1. **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs features, cost vs capabilities
2. **Sweet spots**: Team size ranges where each platform excels
3. **Deal-breakers**: Critical missing features per platform
4. **Future-proofing**: Vendor stability, acquisition risk, AI roadmaps

## Research Sources

**Primary sources**:
- Platform documentation (official feature lists)
- Pricing pages (verified November 2025)
- API documentation
- Integration marketplaces

**Secondary sources**:
- User reviews (G2, Capterra - quantitative feature ratings)
- Comparison articles (TechCrunch, tech.co, SelectHub)
- Community forums (Reddit, HN - real-world usage patterns)

**Validation**:
- Cross-reference features across multiple sources
- Verify pricing with official quotes (where possible)
- Check date of information (features change rapidly)

---

## Time Allocation

**Per deliverable**:
- Feature matrix: 2-3 hours (research + data entry)
- Pricing analysis: 1-2 hours (TCO calculations)
- Integrations ecosystem: 1-2 hours (API docs + testing)
- Permission models: 1 hour (documentation review)
- Mobile experience: 1 hour (app store reviews + testing)
- Synthesis: 1-2 hours (frameworks + insights)

**Total S2 time**: 7-11 hours
