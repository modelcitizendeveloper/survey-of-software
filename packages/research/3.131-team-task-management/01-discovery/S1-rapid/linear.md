- **Related issues**: AI suggests similar issues

**No AI features for**:
- Task generation
- Descriptions / summaries
- Prioritization
- Forecasting

### Why Limited AI?

Linear prioritizes **speed and focus** over AI features. Philosophy: "Ship software, don't fiddle with AI."

**Possible future** (speculation):
