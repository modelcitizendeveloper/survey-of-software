summary: |
  Comprehensive research into Python optimization libraries for mathematical programming
  problems. Research covers library ecosystems, problem types, solver backends, and
  practical selection criteria for generic optimization use cases.

key_findings:
  - "scipy.optimize is ubiquitous (part of 100M+ monthly scipy downloads) but limited to smaller-scale problems and lacks MILP support"
  - "Google OR-Tools (12.6k GitHub stars) emerged as the most popular open-source solver with broad problem type coverage"
  - "HiGHS is the rising star of open-source solvers: adopted by SciPy 1.6.0+ and MATLAB as default LP/MIP solver"
  - "Pyomo (2.1k stars, 123k weekly downloads) leads algebraic modeling with 20+ solver backends"
  - "CVXPY specializes in convex optimization with disciplined convex programming (DCP) analysis"
  - "PuLP 3.3.0 offers simplest entry point for LP/MILP with bundled CBC solver"
  - "Commercial solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX) withdrew from Mittelmann benchmarks in 2024, obscuring performance data"
  - "Problem type (LP vs MILP vs NLP vs convex) is the primary selection criterion, not application domain"

notes: |
  This is Tier 1 research focused on building foundational knowledge about
  Python optimization libraries. Research is application-neutral and organized
  by problem type rather than domain. Findings are based on actual investigation
  of PyPI stats, GitHub metrics, documentation, and academic publications.

  The optimization landscape in 2024-2025 is characterized by strong open-source
  alternatives (HiGHS, SCIP) and reduced transparency from commercial vendors.
  Problem type remains the dominant selection criterion.
