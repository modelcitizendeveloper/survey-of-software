# S2 Comprehensive Analysis: String Metric Libraries

## Methodology

Technical deep-dive into algorithm implementations, performance characteristics, and feature completeness.

**Research approach:**
- Algorithm complexity analysis (time/space)
- Benchmark comparisons across implementations
- API design patterns and ergonomics
- Edge case handling (unicode, null bytes, very long strings)
- Thread safety and concurrency support
- Integration patterns with common frameworks

**Evaluation criteria:**
- **Performance:** Throughput (ops/sec), latency (ms), memory usage
- **Correctness:** Unicode handling, normalization, edge cases
- **API ergonomics:** Ease of use, type safety, error handling
- **Extensibility:** Custom metrics, preprocessing hooks
- **Production readiness:** Thread safety, error recovery, monitoring

**Time investment:** 5-8 hours for technical analysis and benchmarking

**Goal:** Provide technical foundation for architecture and implementation decisions with concrete performance data and API comparisons.
