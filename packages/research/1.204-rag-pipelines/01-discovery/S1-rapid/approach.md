# S1: Rapid Discovery - Approach

## Methodology: Speed-Focused Ecosystem Discovery

**Time Budget:** 10 minutes
**Philosophy:** "Popular libraries exist for a reason"

## Discovery Strategy

This rapid pass focuses on identifying the most widely-adopted RAG pipeline frameworks through ecosystem signals and community metrics.

### Discovery Tools Used

1. **Web Search (2026 Data)**
   - Current GitHub stars and repository activity
   - PyPI download statistics (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Community mentions and adoption signals

2. **Popularity Metrics**
   - GitHub stars as proxy for developer interest
   - Download counts as proxy for production usage
   - Repository maintenance activity (recent commits/releases)

3. **Quick Validation**
   - Does the library specifically support RAG pipelines?
   - Is documentation readily available?
   - Are there active examples and tutorials?

### Selection Criteria

**Primary Factors:**
- **Popularity**: GitHub stars, download counts
- **Active Maintenance**: Recent commits (last 6 months)
- **Clear Documentation**: Quick start guides, RAG examples
- **Production Readiness**: Companies using it in production

**Time Allocation:**
- Library identification: 2 minutes
- Metric gathering: 5 minutes
- Quick assessment: 2 minutes
- Recommendation: 1 minute

## Libraries Evaluated

Three leading RAG pipeline frameworks identified:

1. **LangChain** - Most popular, extensive ecosystem
2. **LlamaIndex** - Data framework specialization, strong RAG focus
3. **Haystack** - Production-oriented, enterprise adoption

## Confidence Level

**70-80%** - This rapid pass provides strategic direction based on current popularity signals. Not comprehensive technical validation, but identifies the market leaders worth deeper investigation.

## Data Sources

- GitHub repository statistics (January 2026)
- PyPI download analytics (January 2026)
- Official documentation and repository README files
- Community discussions and adoption signals

## Limitations

- Speed-optimized: May miss newer/smaller but technically superior libraries
- Popularity bias: Established libraries have momentum advantage
- No hands-on validation: Relies on external signals, not direct testing
- Snapshot in time: Metrics valid as of January 2026

## Next Steps for Deeper Research

For comprehensive evaluation, subsequent passes should examine:
- S2: Performance benchmarks, feature comparisons
- S3: Specific use case validation, requirement mapping
- S4: Long-term maintenance health, strategic viability
