- **Documentation:** Excellent (extensive docs, tutorials, RAG guides)
- **Production Adoption:** Very High (de facto standard for LLM apps)

## Pros

- **Massive ecosystem**: 94M+ monthly downloads indicates widespread production usage
- **RAG-native design**: Built-in support for document chunking, embeddings, vector stores (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)
- **Simple implementation**: RAG pipeline in ~40 lines of code
- **Strong backing**: Created by Harrison Chase, significant community and enterprise adoption
- **Comprehensive integrations**: Vector DBs, LLM providers, document loaders all integrated
- **Active development**: Continuous updates and new features (LangGraph for agents)

- **Complexity overhead**: Large framework may be overkill for simple RAG use cases
- **Version churn**: Rapid development can mean breaking changes
- **Learning curve**: Extensive features require time to master

## Quick Take

LangChain is the market leader for RAG pipelines with overwhelming popularity signals (124K stars, 94M monthly downloads). It's become the de facto standard since its 2022 release.
