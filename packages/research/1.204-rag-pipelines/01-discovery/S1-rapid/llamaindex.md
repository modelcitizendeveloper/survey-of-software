# LlamaIndex

**Repository:** github.com/run-llama/llama_index
**Downloads/Month:** Not available in search results
**GitHub Stars:** 46,395
**Forks:** 6,713
**Last Updated:** January 2026 (active)

## Quick Assessment

- **Popularity:** High (46K stars, strong second to LangChain)
- **Maintenance:** Active (recent updates as of mid-January 2026)
- **Documentation:** Good (Python framework, RAG tutorials available)
- **Production Adoption:** High (300+ integration packages)

## Pros

- **RAG-specialized**: Explicitly marketed as "data framework" for LLM apps with RAG focus
- **Data-centric design**: Purpose-built for connecting LLMs to data sources
- **Rich ecosystem**: 300+ integration packages work seamlessly with core
- **Agent capabilities**: Described as framework for "LLM-powered agents over your data"
- **Strong growth**: Positioned as "leading framework" for data-connected LLM apps
- **Clear positioning**: More focused than general-purpose LangChain

## Cons

- **Smaller community**: ~1/3 the GitHub stars of LangChain
- **Less visibility**: Fewer tutorials and third-party resources
- **Download data missing**: No clear PyPI statistics found, suggests lower adoption
- **Later to market**: Not as established as LangChain

## Quick Take

LlamaIndex positions itself as the data-specialized alternative to LangChain. With 46K GitHub stars and 300+ integrations, it has strong momentum. Best choice for teams who want a framework explicitly designed for connecting LLMs to data (RAG's core use case) without LangChain's broader scope. The data-first philosophy may result in cleaner RAG implementations.
