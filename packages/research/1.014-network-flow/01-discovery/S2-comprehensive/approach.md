# S2 Comprehensive Analysis: Network Flow Libraries

## Analysis Framework

Deep technical comparison across algorithm implementations, API design, performance characteristics, and architectural patterns.

**Evaluation dimensions:**
- Algorithm implementations (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Push-Relabel, variants)
- API ergonomics and developer experience
- Performance benchmarks (small/medium/large graphs)
- Memory efficiency and scalability limits
- Integration patterns with numerical computing stacks

**Methodology:**
- Official documentation analysis
- Algorithm complexity verification
- API pattern extraction via code examples
- Community benchmark aggregation
- Cross-library feature mapping

**Time investment:** 30-45 minutes per library
