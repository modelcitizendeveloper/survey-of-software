# S1 Rapid Discovery: Network Flow Libraries

## Discovery Approach

Ecosystem-driven survey of network flow libraries across Python, C++, and specialized optimization frameworks.

**Focus areas:**
- Maximum flow algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Push-Relabel)
- Minimum cost flow algorithms
- Library maturity and maintenance status
- Performance characteristics for production use
- Integration complexity

**Time investment:** 10-15 minutes per library
**Sources:** GitHub stats, PyPI downloads, Stack Overflow sentiment, official documentation
