# S1-Rapid Approach: Machine Translation APIs

## Objective
Quick survey of major machine translation API providers to understand their basic capabilities, pricing models, and CJK language support.

## Scope
- **Libraries/Services**: DeepL, Google Cloud Translation, Azure Translator, Amazon Translate
- **Focus**: CJK language pairs (zh-en, ja-en, ko-en)
- **Time**: 30-60 minutes per service
- **Depth**: Documentation review, pricing check, feature overview

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **CJK Support**: Which Chinese/Japanese/Korean language variants are supported?
2. **Pricing**: Cost per character/word, free tier availability
3. **API Simplicity**: Ease of integration, authentication methods
4. **Output Quality**: Any published benchmarks or claims about quality
5. **Special Features**: Neural MT, custom models, glossaries, formality

## Method
- Review official documentation
- Check pricing pages
- Identify CJK-specific features or limitations
- Note any quality claims for Asian language pairs

## Constraints
- No hands-on testing in S1
- Relying on vendor documentation and published information
- Not evaluating accuracy (defer to S2/S3)
