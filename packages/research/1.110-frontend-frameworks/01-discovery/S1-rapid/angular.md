# S1 Rapid: Angular

**Quick Snapshot**: Full-featured enterprise framework with declining market share and lowest developer satisfaction.

**Market Share**: 8% of frontend framework market (down from 15% in 2020)

**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## Adoption Metrics

**npm downloads** (weekly, October 2025):
- @angular/core: 3.2M downloads/week

**GitHub**:
- angular: 94K stars, 2,500 issues, 1,400+ contributors

**Company usage**: Google (internal), Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, Upwork, Forbes

**Job market**: 12,000+ Angular job postings (Indeed, October 2025)

---

## Philosophy

**Core concept**: "Full-featured platform" - batteries-included enterprise framework with opinionated structure.

**TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript, strong typing required.

**MVC architecture**: Model-View-Controller pattern, familiar to backend developers.

**CLI-driven**: Angular CLI handles scaffolding, testing, deployment.

---

## Strengths (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Enterprise Features Built-In
- Dependency injection, RxJS observables, forms, routing all included
- No decision fatigue (one way to do things)
- Strong typing with TypeScript

### 2. Google Backing
- Corporate support (Google internal use)
- Regular releases, long-term support
- Official Material Design components

### 3. Strong TypeScript Integration
- Best TypeScript experience (built with TS)
- Excellent IDE autocomplete
- Fewer runtime errors

---

## Weaknesses (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Declining Market Share
- 15% (2020) → 8% (2025), losing ground rapidly
- Negative momentum (biggest red flag for S1)
- Fewer new projects choosing Angular

### 2. Lowest Developer Satisfaction
- 50% satisfaction (State of JS 2024), lowest among major frameworks
- 58% "would not use again"
- High developer frustration

### 3. Largest Bundle Size
- 200kb+ baseline (vs 45kb React, 10kb Svelte)
- Typical app: 500kb-1MB
- Slowest initial load times

---

## Use Cases (When Angular Wins in S1)

1. **Maintaining existing Angular app**: Migration cost too high
2. **Enterprise constraints**: Require Google backing
3. **Large enterprise teams**: Opinionated structure reduces chaos
4. **Strong TypeScript requirement**: Best TS integration

**Note**: S1 methodology finds no compelling reason to choose Angular for NEW projects.

## Rapid Scoring (S1 Criteria)

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Adoption** | 6/10 | 8% market share, 3.2M weekly downloads (declining) |
| **Getting Started** | 5/10 | Steep learning curve, complex concepts |
| **Ecosystem** | 7/10 | Good enterprise ecosystem, Material Design |
| **Hiring** | 7/10 | 12,000 jobs, enterprise-focused talent |
| **Momentum** | 2/10 | Declining market share (15% → 8%), negative trend |
| **TOTAL** | **27/50** | **AVOID for new projects** |

---

## Red Flags / Concerns

**Critical**:
- Declining market share (15% → 8%) signals ecosystem risk
- Lowest developer satisfaction (50%) indicates fundamental issues
- Largest bundle size (200kb+) hurts performance

**Disqualifying for S1**: Negative momentum + low satisfaction = avoid for new projects.

---

## S1 Recommendation

**Status**: **AVOID FOR NEW PROJECTS**

**Rationale**: Angular scores lowest in momentum (2/10) and has lowest developer satisfaction (50%). Declining market share (15% → 8%) signals ecosystem risk. S1 methodology prioritizes popularity and momentum - Angular fails both.

**Confidence**: **HIGH** (clear avoid signal)

**When to choose**:
- Maintaining existing Angular application (migration cost too high)
- Enterprise mandates Google backing
- Team has deep Angular expertise (switching cost high)

**When to avoid** (DEFAULT):
- Any new project (choose React, Vue, or Svelte instead)
- Performance matters (200kb+ baseline)
- Developer satisfaction matters (50% satisfaction)

**S1 conclusion**: Angular is legacy technology. Market has spoken - 58% "would not use again" is disqualifying.
