**Methodology**: Speed-focused ecosystem snapshot for frontend framework evaluation

**Time Budget**: 5-10 minutes per framework (maximum 60 minutes total)

## Discovery Philosophy

**S1 Rapid Discovery** prioritizes immediate actionable insights over deep analysis. Goal: quick landscape overview enabling fast decision-making for time-sensitive projects.

### Core Principles

1. **Popularity as proxy for quality**: Frameworks with high adoption have been battle-tested
2. **Ecosystem maturity**: npm downloads, GitHub stars, Stack Overflow activity indicate health
3. **Getting started speed**: How fast can a developer be productive?
4. **Community momentum**: Growing or declining adoption signals future viability

### Discovery Tools

**Primary Sources** (5-minute snapshot per framework):
- **npm trends**: Download statistics for adoption trajectory
- **GitHub**: Stars, issues, commit activity for community health
- **Stack Overflow**: Question volume for ecosystem maturity
- **State of JS Survey**: Developer satisfaction and awareness
- **Google Trends**: Search volume for mindshare

**Validation Method**:
- Quick "Hello World" test (can I get something running in <15 minutes?)
- Documentation quality check (are official docs clear and complete?)
- Job market snapshot (Indeed/LinkedIn job postings)

### Evaluation Criteria

**Rapid assessment scoring** (0-10 scale):

1. **Adoption** (0-10): Market share, npm downloads, company usage
2. **Getting Started** (0-10): Time to first productive component
3. **Ecosystem** (0-10): Component libraries, tools, plugins available
4. **Hiring** (0-10): Job market size, salary ranges, talent availability
5. **Momentum** (0-10): Growing/stable/declining based on trends

**Total score**: 0-50 points

**Confidence level**:
- High (8-10): Clear winner, overwhelming signals
- Medium (5-7): Strong contender, some trade-offs
- Low (0-4): Niche use case or declining

### Selection Logic

**S1 Rapid methodology** selects based on:
1. **Highest total score** = primary recommendation
2. **Ecosystem + Hiring scores** (combined) as tiebreaker
3. **Momentum score** as risk assessment (negative momentum = caution)

**Output**: One primary recommendation, one alternative, frameworks to avoid.

### Philosophy in Action

**What S1 prioritizes**:
- Battle-tested options (reduce risk)
- Fast time-to-market (popularity = tutorials, examples)
- Hiring feasibility (can we staff the team?)

**What S1 deprioritizes**:
- Cutting-edge performance (unmeasured in rapid phase)
- Long-term strategic fit (S4 domain)
- Perfect requirement matching (S3 domain)

**S1 blind spots**:
- May miss emerging excellent options (low popularity != low quality)
- Overweights ecosystem over technical merit
- Short-term bias (momentum matters more than fundamentals)

### Time Budget Breakdown

| Activity | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Framework popularity research | 5 min/framework | npm, GitHub, State of JS |
| Quick start test | 10 min/framework | "Hello World" + basic component |
| Job market snapshot | 3 min/framework | Indeed, LinkedIn job counts |
| Documentation quality check | 2 min/framework | Scan official getting started |
| Scoring and comparison | 10 min total | Calculate scores, identify winner |
| **Total** | **60 min** | Complete S1 phase |

### Frameworks in Scope

**Primary frameworks** (evaluated):
1. React + Next.js
2. Vue + Nuxt
3. Svelte + SvelteKit
4. Angular
5. Solid + SolidStart

**Out of scope for S1**:
- Legacy frameworks (Ember, Backbone, Knockout)
- Mobile-first frameworks (React Native, Flutter - different domain)
- UI libraries without reactivity (jQuery, Alpine.js)

### Success Criteria

**S1 is successful when**:
- Clear primary recommendation emerges
- Hiring feasibility is validated
- Ecosystem maturity is confirmed
- Time-to-productivity is estimated
- Risk factors are identified (declining momentum)

**S1 fails when**:
- All frameworks score similarly (need S2 depth)
- Popularity conflicts with project needs (need S3 matching)
- Long-term viability unclear (need S4 strategic)

**Recommendation Structure**:

Each framework analysis includes:
- **Quick snapshot**: 1-sentence summary
- **Adoption metrics**: npm downloads, GitHub stars, market share
- **Strengths**: Top 3 advantages for rapid selection
- **Weaknesses**: Top 3 concerns for rapid selection
- **Use cases**: When this framework wins in S1 methodology
- **Score**: 0-50 total (breakdown by criterion)

Final recommendation includes:
- Primary choice (highest score)
- Alternative choice (second highest or different trade-off)
- Avoid list (declining momentum or low ecosystem)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
