# S1 Rapid: Vue + Nuxt

**Quick Snapshot**: Progressive framework with gentle learning curve and strong Asia-Pacific adoption.

**Market Share**: 15% of frontend framework market

**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## Adoption Metrics

**npm downloads** (weekly, October 2025):
- vue: 4.5M downloads/week
- nuxt: 1.2M downloads/week

**GitHub**:
- vue: 206K stars, 600+ issues, 350+ contributors
- nuxt: 48K stars, 800 issues, 300+ contributors

**Company usage**: Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, GitLab, Adobe, Nintendo

**Job market**: 8,000+ Vue job postings (Indeed, October 2025)

## Philosophy

**Core concept**: "Progressive framework" - adopt incrementally, use only what you need.

**Template-based**: Familiar HTML templates with special directives (v-if, v-for, v-model).

**Single-file components**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript in one .vue file.

**Meta-framework (Nuxt)**: Adds SSR, SSG, file-based routing, module ecosystem.

---

## Strengths (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Easiest Learning Curve
- Template syntax familiar to web developers (HTML-like)
- Single-file components reduce context switching
- Official docs are exceptional (clear, comprehensive)

### 2. Lower Hiring Costs
- Vue developers earn 10-15% less than React (salary data)
- Easier to upskill junior developers (gentler learning curve)

### 3. Strong Asia-Pacific Ecosystem
- Dominant in China (Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu)
- Element UI, Vant, Ant Design Vue component libraries
- Large Chinese-language community

---

## Weaknesses (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Smaller Ecosystem
- 3,000+ component libraries (vs 10,000+ React)
- Fewer third-party integrations
- Less English-language content (more Chinese)

### 2. Lower Job Market
- 8,000 jobs vs 50,000 React (6x smaller)
- Harder to hire experienced Vue developers

### 3. Declining Market Share
- 18% (2020) → 15% (2025), losing ground to React
- Momentum is negative (concern for S1)

---

## Use Cases (When Vue Wins in S1)

1. **Learning curve priority**: Easiest framework for beginners
2. **Internal tools**: Smaller ecosystem less critical
3. **Asia-Pacific market**: Strong regional adoption
4. **Budget constraints**: Lower developer salaries
5. **Existing Vue expertise**: Leverage current team skills

## Rapid Scoring (S1 Criteria)

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Adoption** | 7/10 | 15% market share, 4.5M weekly downloads |
| **Getting Started** | 10/10 | Best learning curve, excellent official docs |
| **Ecosystem** | 7/10 | 3,000+ libraries, good but smaller than React |
| **Hiring** | 6/10 | 8,000 jobs, moderate talent pool |
| **Momentum** | 5/10 | Declining market share (18% → 15%), negative trend |
| **TOTAL** | **35/50** | **Solid alternative, not primary** |

---

## Red Flags / Concerns

**Moderate**:
- Declining market share (18% → 15%) signals negative momentum
- Smaller job market makes hiring more difficult
- Ecosystem gap with React creates feature risk

**Not disqualifying**: Still viable, but React safer for S1 methodology.

---

## S1 Recommendation

**Status**: **ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION**

**Rationale**: Vue scores well on learning curve and getting started (10/10), but lower ecosystem and declining momentum make it second choice in S1 methodology.

**Confidence**: **MEDIUM** (good option with trade-offs)

**When to choose**:
- Team values learning curve over ecosystem size
- Building internal tools (less ecosystem dependence)
- Existing Vue expertise on team
- Lower salary costs matter

**When to avoid**:
- Hiring is priority (8,000 jobs vs 50,000 React)
- Complex features needed (ecosystem gap)
- Long-term project (negative momentum concern)
