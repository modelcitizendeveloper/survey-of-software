# S1 Rapid: Solid + SolidStart

**Quick Snapshot**: Cutting-edge framework with best performance and highest satisfaction, but smallest ecosystem and production risk.

**Market Share**: 2% of frontend framework market

**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## Adoption Metrics

**npm downloads** (weekly, October 2025):
- solid-js: 180K downloads/week
- solid-start: 25K downloads/week (beta)

**GitHub**:
- solid: 31K stars, 200 issues, 120+ contributors
- solid-start: 4K stars, 150 issues, 50+ contributors

**Company usage**: Early adopters, no major public deployments yet

**Job market**: 400+ Solid job postings (Indeed, October 2025)

## Philosophy

**Core concept**: "Fine-grained reactivity" - surgical updates without virtual DOM overhead.

**JSX syntax**: Looks like React, behaves completely differently (compiled reactivity).

**No virtual DOM**: Direct reactive primitives, no reconciliation algorithm.

**Meta-framework (SolidStart)**: Beta stage, adds SSR, file-based routing, adapters.

## Strengths (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Highest Developer Satisfaction
- 95% satisfaction (State of JS 2024), highest among all frameworks
- 92% "would use again"
- Developers love working with Solid

### 2. Best Performance
- 15kb baseline (vs 45kb React, 10kb Svelte)
- Fastest runtime (JS Framework Benchmark: 1.1x baseline)
- 20-30% faster than React in benchmarks

### 3. Growing Momentum
- 0% (2020) → 2% (2025), emerging rapidly
- High awareness (80% of developers aware of Solid)
- Strong technical reputation

---

## Weaknesses (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Smallest Ecosystem
- 100+ component libraries (vs 10,000+ React, 500+ Svelte)
- Very limited third-party integrations
- High risk of needing custom solutions

### 2. Extremely Limited Hiring Pool
- 400 jobs vs 50,000 React (125x smaller)
- Nearly impossible to hire experienced Solid developers
- Entire team needs training

### 3. Production Immaturity
- SolidStart still in beta (not production-ready)
- No major production deployments yet
- High risk for business-critical applications

## Use Cases (When Solid Wins in S1)

**S1 methodology finds NO compelling use case for Solid in production**:
- Too small ecosystem (100+ libraries)
- Too difficult to hire (400 jobs, 125x fewer than React)
- Meta-framework not production-ready (SolidStart beta)

**Potential future use cases** (when ecosystem matures):
- Maximum performance applications (games, real-time dashboards)
- Cutting-edge technical teams willing to build custom solutions
- Personal projects / experimentation

## Rapid Scoring (S1 Criteria)

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Adoption** | 2/10 | 2% market share, 180K weekly downloads (tiny) |
| **Getting Started** | 8/10 | Good docs, familiar JSX, but immature meta-framework |
| **Ecosystem** | 2/10 | 100+ libraries, smallest ecosystem by far |
| **Hiring** | 1/10 | 400 jobs, nearly impossible to hire (125x fewer than React) |
| **Momentum** | 7/10 | Growing rapidly (0% → 2%), positive trend but small base |
| **TOTAL** | **20/50** | **TOO RISKY for production** |

---

## Red Flags / Concerns

**Critical**:
- SolidStart (meta-framework) still in beta, not production-ready
- Tiny ecosystem (100+ libraries) requires building everything custom
- Nearly impossible hiring (400 jobs, 125x fewer than React)
- No major production deployments yet (unproven at scale)

**Disqualifying for S1**: Production immaturity + impossible hiring = avoid for business applications.

---

## S1 Recommendation

**Status**: **AVOID FOR PRODUCTION** (experimental only)

**Rationale**: Solid scores lowest overall (20/50) due to ecosystem (2/10) and hiring (1/10). Highest developer satisfaction (95%) doesn't compensate for production risk. S1 methodology prioritizes battle-tested options - Solid is too immature.

**Confidence**: **HIGH** (clear avoid signal for production)

**When to choose**:
- Personal projects / learning
- Experimental prototypes
- Cutting-edge R&D teams
- **NOT production applications**

**When to avoid** (DEFAULT):
- Any production application
- Need to hire developers
- Need stable ecosystem
- Business-critical applications

**S1 conclusion**: Solid is exciting technology but not ready for S1 rapid methodology. Revisit in 2-3 years when ecosystem matures.
