## 5. Key Differentiators

### 1. **Unified HR + IT + Finance Platform**

- Single employee database powers everything
- Change employee role → access automatically updates across all apps
- Competitor requires 3 separate tools (Gusto + Jamf + Expensify)

### 2. **90-Second Onboarding**
- Marketing claim: "Employee 0 to productive in 90 seconds"
- Automated: Generate offer letter → accept → create email → provision laptop → install software → grant access
- Device ships to employee's home pre-configured
- Day 1: Employee unboxes, logs in, ready to work

### 3. **Workflow Automation**
- Visual workflow builder (like Zapier for HR/IT)

### 4. **Global Payroll** (150+ countries)
- Acquired multiple global payroll providers
- Run payroll for U.S. employees + contractors/employees worldwide
- Competitor requires separate global payroll service (Deel, Remote)

### 5. **Modern, Consumer-Grade UI**

- Intuitive vs traditional HRIS (ADP, Oracle feel "enterprise old")

### 6. **Fast Implementation**
- Typical go-live: 1-2 weeks for basic setup
- Payroll cutover: 2-4 weeks total
- Self-service setup (minimal consultant needed)
- Competitor enterprise platforms: 3-12 months (Workday, Oracle)
