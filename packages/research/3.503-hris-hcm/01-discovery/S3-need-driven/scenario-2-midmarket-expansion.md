# S3 Need-Driven: Scenario 2 - Mid-Market Expansion (250 → 1,000 Employees)

**Company Profile**: SunRise Senior Living
**Industry**: Healthcare (assisted living facilities)
**Initial State**: 250 employees across 5 facilities (CA, AZ, TX, FL, NC)
**3-Year Journey**: 250 → 450 → 700 → 1,000 employees
**Workforce**: 70% hourly (caregivers, nurses, facility staff), 30% salaried (administrators, corporate)
**Current HRIS**: ADP Workforce Now (implemented 2 years ago)

---

## Year 0: Starting Point (250 Employees)

### Current State

**Operations**:
- 5 facilities, each 40-60 residents
- 24/7 operations (3 shifts: 7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 11pm-7am)
- State licensing requirements (CA, AZ, TX, FL, NC all have different regulations)
- Medicare/Medicaid billing (requires accurate time tracking for reimbursement)

**HR Team**:
- 1 HR Director (corporate HQ in San Diego)
- 3 HR Generalists (1 covering CA/AZ, 1 covering TX/FL, 1 covering NC + recruiting)
- 1 Payroll Specialist
- **Total**: 5 FTE (1:50 ratio)

**Current HRIS: ADP Workforce Now**:
- Implemented 2 years ago (migrated from Paychex)
- **Annual cost**: $90,000 (Core + Time & Attendance + Talent Mgmt)
- **Modules used**: Payroll, Time & Attendance, Benefits, Basic Performance

**Pain Points**:
1. **Time tracking chaos**: Paper timesheets at 2 facilities (no timeclock), supervisors fax to corporate
2. **Overtime explosion**: Unplanned OT 18% above budget (poor shift scheduling)
3. **Turnover**: 45% annual turnover (caregivers leaving after 6-12 months)
4. **No performance management**: Annual reviews are checkbox exercise, no development plans
5. **Compliance risk**: State-specific training (CA: dementia care, FL: hurricane prep) tracked in spreadsheets
6. **ADP complexity**: HR team finds ADP interface "clunky" (3.9/5 UX rating), reporting difficult

---

## Year 1: Acquisition Strategy Begins (250 → 450 Employees)

### Strategic Shift: Acquire 3 New Facilities

SunRise's board approves growth-by-acquisition strategy:
- **Q2**: Acquire 2-facility operator in Colorado (80 employees)
- **Q4**: Acquire 1-facility operator in Nevada (60 employees)
- **Total**: +140 employees → 390 total by year-end

**Acquired Facilities HRIS State**:
- **Colorado facilities** (80 EE): Using **Paycom** (3-year contract, $30K/year remaining commitment)
- **Nevada facility** (60 EE): Using **Gusto** (month-to-month, $4K/year)

### Problem: Multi-Platform HRIS Mess

**Post-Acquisition HRIS Landscape**:
- **ADP** (250 employees): 5 original SunRise facilities
- **Paycom** (80 employees): 2 Colorado facilities (contract lock-in)
- **Gusto** (60 employees): 1 Nevada facility

**Operational Nightmare**:
- 3 different payroll runs (ADP biweekly, Paycom biweekly, Gusto biweekly on different schedules)
- 3 different org charts (can't see full company org)
- 3 different PTO policies (ADP: accrual, Paycom: frontload, Gusto: unlimited—conflict!)
- Corporate HR reporting: Manual consolidation from 3 systems

**Annual Cost**: $90K (ADP) + $30K (Paycom) + $4K (Gusto) = **$124K total**

---

### Decision Point: Consolidate or Live with Fragmentation?

**Option A: Consolidate on ADP** (Status Quo Expansion)

**Plan**:
- Migrate Gusto (60 EE) → ADP immediately
- Wait out Paycom contract (2 years), then migrate to ADP
- By Year 3, all 450 EE on ADP

**Costs**:
- Migration: $15K (Gusto → ADP)
- Paycom contract buyout: $60K (or wait 2 years, pay $30K/year)
- ADP annual (450 EE): $180,000/year
- **3-Year Total**: $15K + $60K + ($180K × 3) = **$615K**

**Pros**:
- Familiar platform (HR team knows ADP)
- Single vendor relationship
- ADP DataCloud benchmarking (industry turnover, compensation data)

**Cons**:
- ADP UX still "clunky" (3.9/5)—pain points persist
- Expensive (40% more than alternatives)
- Doesn't solve turnover problem (need better employee experience)

---

**Option B: Consolidate on Paylocity** (Modern Alternative)

**Plan**:
- Migrate ADP (250 EE) + Gusto (60 EE) → Paylocity in Year 1
- Buy out Paycom contract ($60K), migrate Colorado (80 EE) → Paylocity
- All 390 EE on Paylocity by Q4

**Costs**:
- Implementation: $120K (Paylocity partner-led for 390 EE)
- Paycom buyout: $60K
- Paylocity annual (450 EE): $135,000/year (avg $25/EE/mo × 12)
- **3-Year Total**: $120K + $60K + ($135K × 3) = **$585K**

**Pros**:
- **Modern UX** (4.5/5 vs. ADP 3.9/5)—better employee adoption
- **Employee engagement features**: Community, Recognition & Rewards (address turnover)
- **$30K cheaper than ADP over 3 years** ($585K vs. $615K)
- **Mobile app** (4.5/5 rating)—caregivers use phones, not desktops

**Cons**:
- **Implementation risk**: Migrating 250 EE from ADP during operations is disruptive
- **Learning curve**: HR team must learn new platform (2-3 months ramp)
- **Paycom buyout**: $60K sunk cost

---

**Option C: Consolidate on Paycom** (Beti® Strategy)

**Plan**:
- Migrate ADP (250 EE) + Gusto (60 EE) → Paycom
- Extend Colorado Paycom contract for full company
- All 390 EE on Paycom by Q4

**Costs**:
- Implementation: $100K (Paycom standard for 390 EE)
- Paycom annual (450 EE): $140,000/year ($26/EE/mo × 12)
- **3-Year Total**: $100K + ($140K × 3) = **$520K**

**Pros**:
- **Cheapest option** ($520K vs. $585K Paylocity, $615K ADP)
- **Beti® ROI**: Employees own payroll → reduces HR payroll workload 90%
- **Single database**: No integrations (all modules in one system)
- **Colorado facilities already on Paycom**: 80 EE have 2-year head start (train other 310 EE)

**Cons**:
- **UX not as modern** (4.2/5 vs. Paylocity 4.5/5)
- **US-only**: If SunRise expands to Canada, Paycom can't support
- **Beti® change management**: Requires employee training (caregivers must review own paychecks)

---

### Decision: Consolidate on Paycom ✅

**Rationale**:

1. **Cost**: **$95K cheaper than ADP** over 3 years ($520K vs. $615K)
2. **Beti® solves payroll pain**: Current payroll specialist spends 60 hours per pay period (26 pay periods × 60 hrs = 1,560 hrs/year = 0.75 FTE). Beti® reduces to 6 hours per pay period (156 hrs/year = 0.08 FTE). **Saves 0.67 FTE = $50K/year**
3. **Colorado head start**: 80 employees already trained on Paycom (leverage for change management)
4. **Healthcare-specific**: Paycom has strong healthcare vertical (many senior living customers)

**Implementation Plan (9 Months)**:

**Phase 1: Colorado Facilities (Already on Paycom)**
- Q1: Audit Colorado Paycom setup, optimize for SunRise corporate standards
- Designate Colorado HR lead as "Paycom champion" (train-the-trainer)

**Phase 2: Nevada Facility (Gusto → Paycom)**
- Q2: Migrate 60 employees from Gusto → Paycom (simplest, test migration process)
- 4-week implementation: Data migration, test payroll, go-live
- **Beti® training**: 2-hour session for all 60 employees

**Phase 3: Original SunRise Facilities (ADP → Paycom)**
- Q3: Migrate 250 employees from ADP → Paycom
- 12-week implementation: Complex (250 EE, 5 facilities, 3-year ADP history to migrate)
- **Change management critical**: 250 employees comfortable with ADP must learn Paycom

**Phase 4: Stabilization**
- Q4: Post-launch support, fine-tuning, quarterly training for new hires

**Go-Live by Facility** (minimize disruption):
1. Nevada (60 EE): June 1
2. Colorado Facility #1 (40 EE): Optimize July 1
3. Colorado Facility #2 (40 EE): Optimize July 1
4. SunRise CA (90 EE): September 1
5. SunRise AZ (60 EE): September 15
6. SunRise TX (40 EE): October 1
7. SunRise FL (40 EE): October 15
8. SunRise NC (20 EE): November 1

---

**Results After 12 Months**:

**Operational Wins**:
- **1 payroll system** vs. 3 (ADP, Paycom, Gusto eliminated fragmentation)
- **Payroll time**: 60 hrs/cycle → 6 hrs/cycle (**90% reduction via Beti®**)
- **Payroll specialist role**: Eliminated (employee promoted to HR Generalist, covering new growth)

**Financial Impact**:
- Annual cost: $140K (vs. $180K on ADP alone) → **$40K/year savings**
- Payroll FTE savings: 0.67 FTE × $75K = **$50K/year**
- **Total annual savings**: $90K

**Employee Experience**:
- **Turnover**: 45% → 38% (7 percentage points improvement)
  - Beti® empowerment: Caregivers feel trusted (reviewing own paychecks)
  - Paycom mobile app: 4.2/5 (vs. ADP 3.9/5)—easier for hourly workforce
- **Payroll errors**: 3.5% → 0.4% (Beti® employee verification catches mistakes before submission)

---

## Year 2: Operational Excellence (450 → 700 Employees)

### Continued Acquisition Growth

**Acquisitions**:
- Q2: 4-facility operator in Oregon/Washington (200 employees)
- Q4: 2-facility operator in Georgia (50 employees)
- **Total**: +250 employees → 700 by year-end

**All Acquired Facilities on Different HRIS**:
- Oregon/Washington (200 EE): Using **ADP** (contract, but willing to migrate)
- Georgia (50 EE): Using **Paylocity** (month-to-month)

**Integration Strategy**: Migrate all to Paycom within 90 days of acquisition close (proven playbook)

### New Challenges: Operational Maturity

**Turnover Still High** (38% → target 25%):
- Exit interviews reveal: "No career development," "Same role for 3 years," "No recognition"
- Need performance management + career pathing + employee recognition

**Compliance Scaling Issues**:
- 10 states, each with different training requirements (dementia care, medication management, emergency prep)
- No LMS (tracking in Excel → fails state audit in Oregon)

**Time Tracking Optimization**:
- Still have 3 facilities using paper timesheets (supervisors manually entering in Paycom)
- Need timeclocks with biometric (fingerprint) to prevent buddy punching

**Shift Scheduling Chaos**:
- Facilities create schedules in Excel, manually enter shifts into Paycom
- No shift swap functionality (employees call supervisor, supervisor updates schedule)
- Overtime still 12% over budget (poor shift optimization)

---

### Decision Point: Paycom Add-Ons vs. Best-of-Breed

**Option A: Paycom All-in-One** (Add Learning + Timeclocks)

**Additions**:
- **Paycom Learning**: $5/employee/month → $42K/year (700 EE)
- **Paycom Timeclocks**: $1,500/clock × 10 facilities × 2 clocks = $30K (one-time)
- **Total Year 2 Cost**: $140K (base) + $42K (learning) + $30K (clocks) = **$212K**

**Pros**:
- Integrated (LMS data in Paycom, compliance training auto-assigns by job/state)
- Timeclock data flows directly to Paycom (no manual entry)
- Single vendor (Paycom support for everything)

**Cons**:
- Paycom LMS is basic (no SCORM advanced features, content library limited)
- Timeclocks are proprietary (locked into Paycom hardware)

---

**Option B: Best-of-Breed** (Paycom + Specialized Tools)

**Additions**:
- **Relias** (Healthcare LMS): $25/employee/year → $17.5K/year (industry-specific courses: dementia, HIPAA, medication mgmt)
- **UKG Timeclocks** (Kronos): $2,000/clock × 10 × 2 = $40K + $10K/year support
- **7shifts** (Shift Scheduling): $4/employee/month → $33.6K/year (shift swaps, labor cost optimization)
- **Total Year 2 Cost**: $140K (Paycom) + $17.5K (Relias) + $40K (UKG) + $10K (UKG support) + $33.6K (7shifts) = **$241K**

**Pros**:
- **Relias**: Healthcare-specific (state-required courses built-in, 5,000+ library)
- **UKG Timeclocks**: Industry standard (biometric, rugged for 24/7 facilities)
- **7shifts**: Purpose-built shift scheduling (AI shift optimization, labor cost forecasting)

**Cons**:
- **$29K/year more expensive** ($241K vs. $212K)
- **Integration complexity**: 3 new systems to integrate with Paycom
- **Operational overhead**: HR team manages 4 platforms instead of 1

---

**Decision: Best-of-Breed (Paycom + Relias + UKG + 7shifts)** ✅

**Rationale**:

1. **Compliance-critical**: Relias has 100% of state-required healthcare courses (Paycom LMS missing 40%)
2. **Turnover ROI**:
   - **Relias career development**: Caregivers can earn certifications (CNA → LPN → RN pathway)
   - Expected turnover reduction: 38% → 28% (10 percentage points)
   - Cost of turnover: 700 EE × 28% turnover = 196 replacements/year × $8K each = $1.57M
   - If turnover drops to 25%: 175 replacements/year × $8K = $1.4M
   - **Annual savings**: $170K (21 fewer replacements)
3. **7shifts labor optimization**:
   - Overtime reduction: 12% over budget → 5% over budget
   - Labor budget: $18M/year (70% of 700 EE × $37K avg salary = $18M)
   - Overtime 12% over = $2.16M → 5% over = $900K
   - **Annual savings**: $1.26M

**ROI Calculation**:
- **Investment**: $29K/year premium (vs. Paycom all-in-one)
- **Savings**: $170K (turnover) + $1.26M (overtime) = **$1.43M/year**
- **ROI**: 49x

---

**Implementation (Q1-Q2 Year 2)**:

**Relias LMS** (8 weeks):
- Import employee roster from Paycom
- Map job codes → required courses (CA CNA → dementia care, medication mgmt, etc.)
- Auto-assign courses by state + job
- Go-live: March 1

**UKG Timeclocks** (12 weeks):
- Install hardware at 10 facilities (2 clocks each: entrance + nurse station)
- Configure badge rules (biometric fingerprint + badge swipe)
- Integration: UKG → Paycom (nightly time punch export)
- Go-live: April 15

**7shifts Scheduling** (6 weeks):
- Build shift templates (7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 11pm-7am)
- Import employee data (Paycom → 7shifts integration)
- Train facility managers on shift creation + swap approvals
- Go-live: June 1

**Results After 12 Months**:

**Compliance**:
- **State audit pass rate**: 60% → 95% (Relias auto-tracking + reminders)
- **Training completion**: 45% overdue → 5% overdue

**Turnover**:
- **Overall turnover**: 38% → 28% (10 percentage points)
  - Caregivers: 55% → 40% (Relias career pathing: CNA → LPN program)
  - Nurses: 25% → 18% (better scheduling via 7shifts → less burnout)
- **Cost savings**: $170K/year (21 fewer replacements)

**Overtime**:
- **Overtime %**: 12% over budget → 5% over budget
- **Annual savings**: $1.26M
- **7shifts AI optimization**: Predicts census (resident occupancy) → staffs appropriately

**Employee Satisfaction**:
- **Shift swap adoption**: 65% of employees use 7shifts self-serve swap (vs. calling supervisor)
- **Paycom + 7shifts mobile**: 4.3/5 combined rating

---

## Year 3: Strategic HR Transformation (700 → 1,000 Employees)

### Final Push: Reach 1,000 Employees

**Acquisitions**:
- Q1: 3-facility operator in Pennsylvania (150 employees)
- Q3: 2-facility operator in Michigan (100 employees)
- Q4: Greenfield facility in Illinois (50 employees, built from scratch)
- **Total**: +300 employees → 1,000 by year-end

**Geographic Footprint**: 15 facilities across 13 states

### New Strategic Priorities

**Performance & Career Development**:
- Turnover now 28% (down from 45%), but still above industry best-in-class (20%)
- Exit interviews: "No clear promotion path," "Performance reviews are once/year checkbox"
- Need: Career ladders, continuous feedback, succession planning

**Compensation Equity**:
- Pay disparities emerging across 13-state footprint (CA caregivers $18/hr, NC caregivers $13/hr—both same cost-of-living adjusted)
- No formal compensation bands
- Merger/acquisition employees have different pay scales

**HR Team Scaling**:
- 5 FTE → 10 FTE needed (1:100 ratio target)
- Roles: 1 VP HR, 2 Regional HRBPs, 4 Facility HR Coordinators, 2 Corporate (recruiting + comp), 1 HRIS Admin

**Compliance at Scale**:
- 13 states × 10 different training requirements = 130 compliance rules
- Need centralized compliance dashboard (current: tracking in Relias + Excel)

---

### Decision Point: Stay on Paycom or Upgrade to Workday?

**Option A: Stay on Paycom + Continue Best-of-Breed**

**Setup**:
- Paycom (HRIS, payroll, time): $260K/year (1,000 EE)
- Relias (LMS): $25K/year
- UKG (timeclocks): $10K/year support
- 7shifts (scheduling): $48K/year
- **Add**: Lattice (Performance): $40K/year (1,000 EE × $3.33/mo)
- **Add**: ChartHop (Org design + comp): $36K/year
- **Total**: **$419K/year**

**Pros**:
- Familiar (HR team knows Paycom)
- Best-of-breed tools (Lattice best-in-class performance, Relias healthcare-specific)
- Cost: $419/employee/year

**Cons**:
- **6 platforms to manage** (Paycom, Relias, UKG, 7shifts, Lattice, ChartHop)
- **Integration tax**: 1 FTE HRIS Admin to manage integrations ($90K/year)
- **Data fragmentation**: Org chart in Paycom, performance in Lattice, comp in ChartHop

---

**Option B: Upgrade to Workday HCM**

**Setup**:
- Workday HCM Suite (HRIS, payroll, talent, time, learning): $150K/year (1,000 EE × $150/year)
- Workday Skills Cloud (included)
- Keep: UKG timeclocks ($10K/year—Workday integrates)
- Keep: 7shifts ($48K/year—Workday time module not as good for shift optimization)
- Keep: Relias ($25K/year—healthcare-specific content)
- **Implementation**: $600K (one-time, Year 1)
- **Total Year 1**: $833K (includes $600K implementation)
- **Total Year 2+**: $233K/year

**Pros**:
- **Strategic HR**: Skills Cloud, talent marketplace, succession planning (IPO/PE-ready)
- **Unified HCM+Finance**: If SunRise implements Workday Financials, data unified
- **Cheaper long-term**: $233K/year (Year 2+) vs. $419K Paycom best-of-breed
- **Free test environments** (vs. Oracle)

**Cons**:
- **Year 1 brutal**: $833K total cost (vs. $419K staying on Paycom)
- **12-month implementation**: Disruptive during 1,000-employee scale
- **Learning curve**: HR team must learn enterprise platform (Workday 3.8/5 UX vs. Paycom 4.2/5)
- **Overkill**: 1,000 employees at low end of Workday's sweet spot (2,000+)

---

**Decision: Stay on Paycom + Best-of-Breed** ✅

**Rationale**:

1. **Workday too early**: 1,000 employees at Workday's lower threshold (sweet spot 2,000+)
2. **Implementation disruption**: Can't afford 12-month Workday project during high-growth phase
3. **Best-of-breed working**: Paycom + Relias + 7shifts + Lattice delivers 90% of Workday's value at half the cost
4. **Revisit at 2,000 employees**: If SunRise continues M&A, reevaluate Workday at 2,000 EE (Series B/PE buyout)

**Add-Ons for Year 3**:

**Lattice** (Performance Management):
- Annual reviews + continuous feedback + 1:1s + OKRs
- **Career ladders**: Build CNA → LPN → RN → Nurse Manager → Director of Nursing progression
- **360-degree feedback**: For facility managers and corporate leadership
- **Cost**: $40K/year (1,000 EE)

**ChartHop** (Org Design + Compensation):
- Real-time org chart (visualize 15 facilities, 13 states, 1,000 employees)
- Compensation bands (by role, state, cost-of-living adjustment)
- Headcount planning (tie to financial budget)
- **Cost**: $36K/year

**Integration Architecture** (Year 3 Final State):

## 3-Year Journey: Financial Summary

| Year | Employees | Platform(s) | Annual Cost | Per EE/Year | Major Event |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Year 0** | 250 | ADP (+ Paycom/Gusto fragments) | $124,000 | $496 | Status quo (3 systems) |
| **Year 1** | 450 | Paycom (consolidated) | $140,000 | $311 | Consolidation to Paycom |
| **Year 2** | 700 | Paycom + Relias + UKG + 7shifts | $241,000 | $344 | Add best-of-breed tools |
| **Year 3** | 1,000 | Paycom + 5 integrations | $419,000 | $419 | Strategic HR (Lattice, ChartHop) |

**Total 3-Year Spend**: $900,000 ($360/employee/year average)

**Avoided Costs**:
- Staying on ADP: $540K (3 years at $180K/year for 1,000 EE) → **Saved $121K**
- Migrating to Workday Year 3: $833K (Year 1) → **Saved $414K** (vs. Paycom $419K Year 3)

## Key Business Outcomes

### 1. Turnover Reduction (45% → 25%)

| Initiative | Turnover Impact | Annual Savings |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Beti® empowerment** | 45% → 40% | $40K (5 fewer replacements × $8K) |
| **Relias career development** | 40% → 30% | $80K (10 fewer replacements) |
| **7shifts better scheduling** | 30% → 28% | $16K (2 fewer replacements) |
| **Lattice performance mgmt** | 28% → 25% | $24K (3 fewer replacements) |
| **Total** | **45% → 25%** | **$160K/year** |

**3-Year Turnover Savings**: $480K

**Cost of Initiatives**: $419K (Year 3 HRIS stack) vs. $124K (Year 0 ADP only) = **$295K/year premium**

**Net Savings**: $480K - $295K = **$185K positive over 3 years**

---

### 2. Overtime Optimization ($1.26M/Year Savings)

**Before 7shifts** (Year 1):
- Overtime: 12% over budget
- Annual labor: $18M → Overtime: $2.16M

**After 7shifts** (Year 2):
- Overtime: 5% over budget (AI shift optimization)
- Annual labor: $25M (700 EE) → Overtime: $1.25M
- **Savings**: 12% - 5% = 7% × $25M = **$1.75M** (but some of 7% is efficiency, not just 7shifts)
- **Attributable to 7shifts**: ~$1.26M (conservative)

**7shifts Cost**: $48K/year

**ROI**: $1.26M / $48K = **26x**

---

### 3. Payroll Efficiency (Beti®)

**Before Beti®** (Year 0, ADP):
- Payroll Specialist: 60 hours/pay period × 26 = 1,560 hours/year
- Cost: 1,560 × $50/hr = **$78K/year** (1.95 FTE payroll workload)

**After Beti®** (Year 1, Paycom):
- Payroll Specialist: 6 hours/pay period × 26 = 156 hours/year
- Cost: 156 × $50/hr = **$7.8K/year** (0.2 FTE)
- **Savings**: 1.75 FTE × $40K = **$70K/year**

**Payroll Specialist redeployed**: Promoted to HR Generalist (covering new facilities post-acquisition)

---

### 4. Compliance Improvement

**State Audit Results**:
- **Year 0 (Excel tracking)**: 60% pass rate (failed CA, FL audits → $50K fines)
- **Year 2 (Relias)**: 95% pass rate (passed all state audits)

**Fines Avoided**: $50K/year

**Relias Cost**: $25K/year

**Net Savings**: $25K/year

## Lessons Learned: Mid-Market Playbook

### 1. Consolidate Early (Year 1, Not Year 3)

**Mistake to Avoid**: Living with fragmented HRIS post-acquisition
- 3 platforms (ADP, Paycom, Gusto) created operational nightmare
- Consolidation to Paycom in Year 1 eliminated: 3 payroll runs, 3 org charts, manual reporting

**Timing**: Consolidate within 90 days of acquisition close (while integration energy is high)

---

### 2. Best-of-Breed Beats All-in-One (For Healthcare)

**SunRise's Stack**:
- Paycom: Core HRIS + payroll + Beti®
- Relias: Healthcare-specific LMS (state-required courses)
- UKG: Timeclocks (biometric, ruggedized for 24/7)
- 7shifts: Shift scheduling AI (labor cost optimization)
- Lattice: Performance management
- ChartHop: Org design + compensation

**Why Not Paycom All-in-One?**
- Paycom LMS missing 40% of state-required healthcare courses → compliance risk
- Paycom shift scheduling basic → missed $1.26M/year overtime savings (7shifts AI)

**Integration Tax**: 1 FTE HRIS Admin ($90K/year) to manage 6 platforms

**ROI**: Best-of-breed delivers $1.43M/year savings (turnover + overtime) vs. $90K integration cost = **16x ROI**

---

### 3. Beti® Is Real (But Requires Change Management)

**Paycom's Beti® Effectiveness**:
- Payroll workload: 1.95 FTE → 0.2 FTE (**90% reduction**)
- Payroll errors: 3.5% → 0.4% (employee verification catches mistakes)
- Employee empowerment: Caregivers feel trusted (reviewing own paychecks)

**Change Management Critical**:
- 2-hour training per employee (facility-by-facility rollout)
- Supervisors must stop "fixing" employee paychecks (resist urge to intervene)
- First 3 months: 20% of employees call HR with Beti® questions → drops to 2% by Month 6

**Lesson**: Beti® works, but only if organization commits to employee-driven model (not "HR drives, employees click approve")

---

### 4. Don't Upgrade to Workday Too Early

**SunRise Considered Workday at 1,000 Employees**:
- Year 1 cost: $833K (includes $600K implementation)
- Workday sweet spot: 2,000+ employees
- At 1,000 EE, best-of-breed ($419K) delivers 90% of value at 50% of cost

**When to Reevaluate Workday**:
- 2,000 employees (mid-point of Workday range)
- PE buyout / IPO preparation (need enterprise talent management)
- Implementing Workday Financials (HCM+Finance unification compelling)

**Lesson**: Resist enterprise HRIS until organization truly needs strategic workforce planning, skills intelligence, talent marketplace

---

## Decision Framework: Mid-Market Healthcare HRIS

### Phase 1: 250-500 Employees
- **Platform**: Paycom (if US-only) OR ADP Workforce Now (if risk-averse)
- **Why Paycom**: Beti® saves 90% payroll workload, single database, $150-250/EE/year
- **Add-Ons**: Healthcare LMS (Relias $25/EE/year), timeclocks (UKG), shift scheduling (7shifts)

### Phase 2: 500-1,000 Employees
- **Platform**: Stay on Paycom + best-of-breed integrations
- **Add**: Performance (Lattice $40K), compensation (ChartHop $36K)
- **Cost**: $300-450/EE/year (including integrations)
- **Don't**: Migrate to Workday yet (too early, too expensive, too disruptive)

### Phase 3: 1,000-2,000 Employees
- **Decision Point**: Evaluate Workday HCM
- **Triggers**:
  - PE buyout / IPO preparation (need enterprise talent mgmt)
  - Implementing Workday Financials (HCM+Finance)
  - 15+ states (compliance complexity favors unified platform)
  - Integration tax exceeding $150K/year (6+ platforms to manage)

### Phase 4: 2,000+ Employees
- **Platform**: Workday HCM (likely, unless deep commitment to Paycom + best-of-breed)
- **Cost**: $300-500/EE/year (Workday becomes cost-competitive at scale)
- **Implementation**: 12-18 months, plan 2 years before IPO
