## 4PS Structure

This research follows the Four-Pass System (4PS) for progressive knowledge organization:

### S1-rapid/ - Quick Discovery
- **Purpose**: Fast reference for immediate needs
- **File**: `quick-reference.md`
- **Use when**: You need to start implementing quickly
- **Contains**:
  - Quick-start guide
  - Resource comparison table
  - Licensing quick check
  - 5-minute integration examples

### S2-comprehensive/ - Complete Coverage
- **Purpose**: Full catalog of all available resources
- **File**: `data-source-catalog.md`
- **Use when**: You need comprehensive information
- **Contains**:
  - All SVG data sources (Make Me a Hanzi, KanjiVG, HanziVG, animCJK, Hanzi Writer)
  - Online animated dictionaries
  - Stroke count databases (ChineseStrokes, Unihan, cjklib, KRADFILE)
  - Reference data sources

### S3-need-driven/ - Practical Application
- **Purpose**: Implementation guidance and use cases
- **File**: `implementation-guide.md`
- **Use when**: You're building something specific
- **Contains**:
  - Licensing considerations
  - Data format recommendations
  - Technical integration examples (web, mobile, backend)
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Use cases (practice, dictionary lookup, handwriting recognition, gamification)
  - Educational platform integration
  - Tech stack recommendations
  - Code examples (React, Node.js, Python)
  - Testing and deployment checklists

### S4-strategic/ - High-Level Planning
- **Purpose**: Strategic roadmap and long-term planning
- **File**: `implementation-roadmap.md`
- **Use when**: Planning a project from scratch
- **Contains**:
  - Research gaps and future opportunities
  - 8-week implementation roadmap (5 phases)
  - Success metrics (engagement, learning outcomes, business, technical)
  - Risk assessment and mitigation
  - Strategic recommendations
  - Go-to-market strategy
  - Monetization options
  - Critical success factors

## Reading Recommendations

**If you want to start building right now**:
1. Read S1-rapid for quick start
2. Jump to S3-need-driven for implementation examples

**If you need complete information**:
1. Start with S2-comprehensive for full catalog
2. Reference S3-need-driven for specific integration needs

**If you're planning a full project**:
1. S1-rapid for context
2. S4-strategic for roadmap
3. S3-need-driven for implementation details
4. S2-comprehensive for data source specifics

**If you're comparing options**:
- S1-rapid has comparison tables
- S2-comprehensive has detailed features
- S4-strategic has recommendations

## Key Findings Summary

- **Best for web apps**: Hanzi Writer (easiest integration)
- **Best for custom needs**: Make Me a Hanzi or KanjiVG (direct SVG access)
- **Best for stroke counts**: CCDB API or cjklib
- **Coverage**: 9,000+ Chinese characters, full Japanese kanji coverage
- **All resources**: Open-source with permissive licenses
- **Time to MVP**: < 1 week for basic web implementation
