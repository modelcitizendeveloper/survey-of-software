# S1: Rapid Discovery - Approach

## Methodology

Quick survey of widely-adopted string algorithm libraries across major programming ecosystems. Focus on libraries with strong community adoption, active maintenance, and clear documentation.

## Selection Criteria

- **Popularity**: High download counts, GitHub stars, community recognition
- **Maintenance**: Active development, recent releases, responsive maintainers
- **Scope**: General-purpose string processing capabilities
- **Documentation**: Clear API docs, examples, tutorials

## Coverage

Surveying libraries across:
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Rust
- Go
- Java/JVM
- C/C++

## Time Box

This phase aims for breadth over depth - identifying the "obvious choices" that developers reach for first when needing string algorithm capabilities.
