# Key findings by phase
key_findings:

    - "Clear 'go-to' libraries exist for common needs (regex, fuzzy matching, parsing)"
    - "Safety-focused regex engines (RE2, Rust regex) recommended for untrusted input"
    - "Unicode support requires specialized libraries (ICU, unicode-*)"

  s2_comprehensive:
    - "Algorithm choice depends on scale: naive O(n·m) adequate for small inputs, Aho-Corasick O(n+m+z) for multi-pattern"
    - "Regex engines divide into backtracking (expressive, exponential worst case) vs DFA (safe, linear time)"
    - "Unicode complexity: graphemes ≠ code points ≠ bytes, normalization critical for comparison"
    - "Security: injection vulnerabilities from string concatenation, ReDoS from nested quantifiers"

  s3_need_driven:
    - "Web applications: auto-escaping templates mandatory, validation at boundaries, normalize before storage"
    - "CLI tools: streaming for large files, terminal detection for colors/progress, glob for file matching"
    - "Scale determines complexity: simple solutions sufficient until measured bottleneck"
    - "Security cannot be retrofitted: must be designed into architecture (parameterized queries, escaping, timeouts)"

  s4_strategic:
    - "Default to standard libraries (95% of use cases), deviate only for measured 10x impact"
    - "Architecture patterns: centralized normalization, lazy parsing, string interning, compilation pipelines"
    - "Security is a design decision with 5-year impact: choose DoS-resistant algorithms, auto-escaping templates"
    - "Optimization is investment: ROI = (business impact × frequency) / (engineering cost × risk)"
