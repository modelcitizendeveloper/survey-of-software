# S3-Need-Driven: Approach

## Methodology

Evaluate libraries based on concrete use cases rather than abstract features. For each use case:

1. **Define the goal** - What does the user want to accomplish?
2. **Map to requirements** - What technical capabilities are needed?
3. **Test fit** - Which libraries can deliver this?
4. **Identify gaps** - What's missing?

## Use Case Categories

Based on common needs for Chinese morphological analysis:

### 1. Educational/Learning
- Character etymology and learning aids
- Radical-based character lookup
- Understanding character construction
- Vocabulary building through component analysis

### 2. Search & Information Retrieval
- Component-based search
- Fuzzy matching by structural similarity
- Radical-based indexing
- Character variant handling

### 3. Text Analysis & Processing
- Word segmentation for NLP pipelines
- POS tagging and parsing
- Named entity recognition
- Document processing

### 4. Linguistic Research
- Character structure analysis
- Etymology research
- Historical character evolution
- Compound word formation patterns

### 5. Font & Typography
- Glyph component analysis
- Stroke order validation
- Font design pattern extraction
- Character rendering optimization

## Evaluation Criteria Per Use Case

- **Capability match:** Does the tool provide needed functionality?
- **Data quality:** Is the underlying data accurate and comprehensive?
- **Ease of use:** How much custom code is needed?
- **Performance:** Can it handle expected data volumes?
- **Maintenance:** Is it sustainable long-term?

## Use Cases Analyzed

Will create separate markdown files for:
1. `use-case-educational.md` - Learning and teaching tools
2. `use-case-search.md` - Search and retrieval systems
3. `use-case-nlp-pipeline.md` - Text processing pipelines
4. `use-case-linguistic-research.md` - Academic research
5. `use-case-etymology.md` - Character origin and evolution study

Each file will map the use case to library recommendations with specific implementation guidance.
