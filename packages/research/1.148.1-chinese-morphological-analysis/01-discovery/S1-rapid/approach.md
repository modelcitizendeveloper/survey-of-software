# S1-Rapid: Approach

## Evaluation Method

Quick assessment of available libraries for Chinese morphological analysis and character decomposition based on:

1. **Active Maintenance** - Is the project still maintained? Recent releases?
2. **Core Capabilities** - Does it address character decomposition and/or morphological analysis?
3. **Ease of Access** - Available via PyPI? Clear documentation?
4. **First Impressions** - Documentation quality, community size, obvious strengths/weaknesses

## Libraries Evaluated

1. **HanLP** - Multilingual NLP toolkit
2. **Stanza** - Stanford NLP with Universal Dependencies support
3. **LTP** - Language Technology Platform (HIT)
4. **cjklib** - Han character library for CJKV languages

## Time Box

45-60 minutes per library for initial investigation. Focus on:
- What it claims to do
- How mature it appears
- Whether it handles our specific needs (character decomposition, compound analysis)

## Decision Criteria

- Can it decompose characters into components/radicals?
- Can it analyze compound words?
- Is it production-ready?
- Python support quality
