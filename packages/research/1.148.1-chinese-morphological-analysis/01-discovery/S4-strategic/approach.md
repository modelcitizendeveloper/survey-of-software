# S4-Strategic: Approach

## Evaluation Method

Assess long-term viability and strategic considerations for each approach beyond immediate technical capabilities.

## Strategic Dimensions

### 1. Maintenance & Longevity
- Is the project actively maintained?
- Risk of abandonment?
- Community health and contribution patterns
- Corporate vs. academic backing

### 2. Evolution & Adaptation
- Can the tool adapt to new requirements?
- Extensibility and customization options
- Migration paths if needs change
- Future-proofing considerations

### 3. Ecosystem Integration
- Does it play well with other tools?
- Standard formats and protocols?
- Community libraries and extensions
- Lock-in risks

### 4. Resource Requirements
- Development effort for integration
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Infrastructure costs
- Team skill requirements

### 5. Legal & Compliance
- License compatibility
- Data licensing and attribution
- Export/usage restrictions
- IP considerations

### 6. Build vs. Buy vs. Data
- Library adoption
- Build custom on open data
- Use existing data sources directly
- Hybrid approaches

## Assessment Framework

For each major approach:

1. **Current State** - Where is it today?
2. **Trajectory** - Where is it heading?
3. **Risks** - What could go wrong?
4. **Mitigation** - How to manage risks?
5. **Exit Strategy** - How to pivot if needed?

## Approaches to Assess

### Approach A: cjklib (Legacy Library)
- Python 2 codebase
- Comprehensive functionality
- Fork for Python 3 (cjklib3)

### Approach B: makemeahanzi (Data-First)
- Open JSON data
- No library dependency
- Build custom tooling

### Approach C: NLP Platforms (HanLP/Stanza/LTP)
- Production NLP pipelines
- Character analysis secondary

### Approach D: Hybrid (Data + Tools)
- Combine data sources with libraries
- Selective integration

Will create separate viability assessments for each approach with strategic recommendations.
