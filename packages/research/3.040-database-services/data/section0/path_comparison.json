      "Full control (version, extensions, tuning)",

      "No vendor lock-in"

    "pros": [
      "LOW lock-in (can migrate between providers, 8-40 hours)",
      "Zero operational burden (managed backups, updates, scaling)",
      "PostgreSQL standard (PromQL, extensions, tools all work)",
      "Easy migration path (pg_dump/restore)"

    "cons": [
      "Higher cost ($25-500/month depending on provider, scale)",

    "justification": [
      "LOW lock-in (can switch providers in 8-40 hours)",
      "50+ compatible providers (flexibility)",
      "30+ years stable (proven, mature)",
      "Rich ecosystem (extensions, tools, expertise)",

    "avoid_postgresql_when": [
      "Need specific NoSQL features (DynamoDB global tables, Firestore real-time)",

      "Team has zero SQL expertise and can't learn (rare)"

    "bottom_line": "PostgreSQL is the safe, portable choice for 90% of applications. Use proprietary DB only when unique features clearly justify lock-in."
