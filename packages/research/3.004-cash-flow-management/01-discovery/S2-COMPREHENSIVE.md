## Implementation Complexity Assessment

### Setup Time Estimates

| Platform | Initial Setup | Data Migration | Training Time | Time-to-Value |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pulse | 30 min | 1 hour (QB sync) | 1 hour | Day 1 |
| Fathom | 1 hour | 2 hours (multi-platform) | 2 hours | Day 2-3 |
| Finmark | 2 hours | 3 hours (QB + payroll) | 4 hours | Week 1 |

| Mosaic | 2 weeks | 3 weeks (25+ integrations) | 2 weeks | Month 2 |
| Dryrun | 1 week | 1 week (ERP sync) | 1 week | Month 1 |
| PlanGuru | 4 hours | 1 day (historical data) | 2 days | Week 2 |

**Finding:** Implementation time correlates with integration count. Simple tools (Pulse) = Day 1. Enterprise tools (Mosaic, Causal) = Month 1-2.

---

## Migration & Lock-In Assessment

### Escape Cost Analysis

| Platform | Data Export | Format | Rebuild Effort | Escape Cost (Hours) | Lock-In Level |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pulse | CSV export | CSV | Low (5 hours) | $750-1,500 | Low |
| Fathom | Export available | Likely CSV/Excel | Medium (10 hours) | $1,500-3,000 | Low-Medium |
| Finmark | Not specified | Likely CSV | Medium (10 hours) | $1,500-3,000 | Medium |
| Jirav | Not specified | Likely CSV | Medium (15 hours) | $2,250-4,500 | Medium |
| Causal | Export available | CSV + model export | High (20 hours - complex models) | $3,000-6,000 | Medium-High |
| Mosaic | Not specified | Likely API/CSV | High (30 hours - 25+ integrations) | $4,500-9,000 | High |
| Dryrun | Integration data + manual | Mixed | High (25 hours - scenarios) | $3,750-7,500 | Medium-High |
| PlanGuru | Export to Excel | Excel | Medium (10 hours) | $1,500-3,000 | Medium |

**Calculation:** Escape cost = (Setup hours in new platform) + (Data migration hours) + (Rebuild automations/scenarios) × $150/hr consulting rate

**Lock-In Spectrum:**
```
Low Lock-In          Medium Lock-In        High Lock-In
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pulse ($750-1,500)   Finmark/Jirav          Mosaic ($4,500-9,000)
Fathom ($1,500-3K)   ($1,500-4,500)         Causal ($3,000-6,000)
                     Dryrun/PlanGuru
```

**Finding:** Lock-in correlates with:
1. Integration count (more integrations = more migration work)
2. Model complexity (Causal's multi-dimensional models hard to rebuild)
3. Scenario depth (Dryrun's advanced scenarios hard to replicate)

## S2 Key Findings

### 1. Market is Highly Segmented
Three clear tiers with minimal overlap:
- **Small business:** Pulse, Fathom ($29-150/mo)
- **Startup/SMB:** Finmark, Jirav, Causal ($100-500/mo)
- **Mid-market:** Mosaic, Dryrun ($500-2,000+/mo)

**Attempting to use wrong-tier platform = poor fit.** Don't use Mosaic for 10-person company. Don't use Pulse for 100-person company.

### 2. Integration Breadth Defines Price Tier
- 1-6 integrations = $29-150/mo (Pulse, Fathom)
- 8-15 integrations = $100-500/mo (Finmark, Jirav, Causal)
- 25+ integrations = $500-2,000/mo (Mosaic)

**Implication:** Pay for integrations you actually use, not integrations that exist.

### 3. Unlimited User Models are Rare & Valuable
Only 3 platforms offer unlimited users:
- Pulse (all tiers)
- Finmark (all tiers)
- Fathom (all tiers)

**Value prop:** Eliminates per-seat pricing anxiety. Teams can collaborate freely without budget conversations.

### 4. Pricing Opacity = Complex, Custom Deals
Platforms hiding pricing (Causal, Mosaic, Dryrun, Fathom):
- Custom pricing based on company size, integrations, features
- Negotiation expected
- Enterprise sales cycle (weeks, not hours)

Platforms with transparent pricing (Pulse, Jirav, Finmark):
- Self-service signup
- Credit card, start immediately
- SMB/startup focus

### 5. Scenario Modeling Separates Leaders
**Basic:** Pulse (toggle on/off)
**Good:** Finmark, Jirav, Causal (unlimited scenarios, side-by-side comparison)
**Best:** Dryrun (scenario modeling is THE product)

**Pattern:** Scenario quality matters for:
- Fundraising (show multiple outcomes to investors)
- M&A (model acquisition scenarios)
- Restructuring (evaluate cost-cutting options)

If scenarios aren't critical to your business, don't pay premium for Dryrun.

### 6. AI is Emerging, Not Mature
Only 2 platforms have AI:
- Mosaic (Arc AI - insights, anomalies, predictions)
- Jirav (AI-powered budgeting, forward-looking forecasts)

**Implication:** AI is NOT table-stakes yet. Most platforms rely on traditional modeling.

**Prediction:** AI will become standard within 2-3 years (all platforms will add it).

### 7. Data Warehouse Integration = Enterprise-Grade
Only 2 platforms support data warehouses:
- Causal (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks)
- Mosaic (Snowflake)

**Signal:** If platform supports Snowflake, it's enterprise-grade. Data warehouse = sophisticated data ops.

## Next Steps: S3 & S4

**S3 (Need-Driven) will answer:**
- Which platform for MY specific industry? (SaaS vs. retail vs. services)
- Which platform for MY company stage? (pre-revenue vs. Series B vs. established)
- Which platform for MY technical sophistication? (Excel-dependent vs. modern stack)
- 15+ specific scenarios with platform recommendations

**S4 (Strategic) will answer:**
- Which platforms will exist in 5 years? (vendor stability, funding, M&A risk)
- When should I build vs. buy? (self-hosted alternatives, DIY economics)
- What are future trends? (AI, real-time, predictive)
- Lock-in mitigation strategies (how to preserve optionality)

---

**S2 Conclusion:** Cash flow/FP&A SaaS market is mature and well-segmented. Platform choice depends on: company size (employees), budget (monthly spend), integration needs (accounting + payroll + CRM?), and sophistication (Excel-friendly vs. modern). No single winner—pick your tier, then evaluate 2-3 platforms within that tier.
