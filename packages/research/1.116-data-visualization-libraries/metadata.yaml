key_findings:
  - finding: "Recharts dominates React ecosystem with 9M weekly downloads (18x nearest competitor)"
    impact: "Largest community, most tutorials, safest choice for standard React dashboards"
    confidence: high

  - finding: "SVG-based libraries hit performance wall at ~1000 data points (8 FPS)"
    impact: "Must switch to Canvas (Chart.js, ECharts) for 1K-10K points, WebGL (ECharts) for 1M+ points"
    confidence: high

  - finding: "ECharts is only library handling massive datasets (10M+ points via WebGL)"
    impact: "No alternative for applications requiring visualization of millions of data points"
    confidence: high

recommendations:
  default: "Use Recharts for standard React dashboards, ECharts for large datasets (10K+ points), visx for custom visualizations"

  by_use_case:
    standard_react_dashboard: "Recharts - dominant ecosystem, declarative JSX, 9M weekly downloads"
    large_datasets_1k_10k: "Chart.js or ECharts - Canvas rendering handles 1K-10K points smoothly"
    large_datasets_1M_plus: "ECharts with WebGL - only option for millions of data points"
    custom_visualizations: "visx - D3 power with React patterns, no DOM manipulation conflicts"
    framework_agnostic: "Chart.js - smallest bundle (60 KB), works everywhere, 13 years mature"
    react_native: "Victory Native - only viable React Native option, cross-platform API"
    server_side_rendering: "Nivo - built-in SSR support for Next.js/Gatsby/email reports"
    enterprise_longevity: "D3 (10+ year projects) or ECharts (Apache backing) - maximum viability"
    maximum_control: "D3 - low-level toolkit, any visualization possible, rendering-agnostic"

  by_timeline:
    one_to_two_years: "Optimize for development speed - Recharts (React), Chart.js (agnostic)"
    three_to_five_years: "Balance speed and longevity - Recharts, Chart.js, ECharts"
    five_plus_years: "Prioritize longevity - D3, ECharts, Recharts (monitor health quarterly)"
    ten_plus_years: "Infrastructure-level only - D3 (only guaranteed), ECharts (Apache backing)"

  performance_thresholds:
    under_500_points: "Any library works - Recharts (React), Chart.js (agnostic) for simplicity"
    500_to_5000_points: "Canvas required - Chart.js or ECharts"
    5000_to_50000_points: "Optimized Canvas - ECharts"
    50000_plus_points: "WebGL required - ECharts (only option)"

  strategic_guidance:
    risk_mitigation: "Use vendor abstraction layer for 5+ year projects with medium-risk libraries"
    data_portability: "Use standard data formats, transform at library boundary for easy migration"
    health_monitoring: "Quarterly health checks (commits, downloads, issues) with migration planning"
    migration_budget: "Budget 10-20% for rewrites - ecosystem evolves, plan for change"

methodology_notes: |
  Research conducted using 4PS framework (S1-S4):
  - S1: Library comparison across 7 major options (Recharts, D3, ECharts, Chart.js, visx, Nivo, Victory)
  - S2: Technical deep-dive into rendering tech, API patterns, performance characteristics
  - S3: Use case analysis for 4 personas (React dashboard dev, data scientist, mobile dev, custom viz designer)
  - S4: Strategic viability analysis with 5-10 year projections and risk mitigation strategies

  Performance benchmarks based on rendering technology limitations (SVG ~1K points, Canvas ~10K, WebGL 1M+).
  Download statistics from npm trends as of December 2025.
  Viability assessments consider corporate backing, Apache Foundation governance, and ecosystem maturity.
