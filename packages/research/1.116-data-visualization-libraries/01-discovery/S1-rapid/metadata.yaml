research_question: |
  What are the leading data visualization libraries for React in 2025?
  How do high-level libraries (Recharts, Nivo, Victory) compare?
  When should you use low-level D3 vs high-level abstractions?
  What about performance with large datasets?

key_findings:
  - finding: "Recharts dominates React charts with 9M weekly downloads"
    implication: "Default choice for React dashboards"

  - finding: "Canvas outperforms SVG for 1000+ data points"
    implication: "Use ECharts or Chart.js for large datasets"

  - finding: "D3.js has 108K stars but steep learning curve"
    implication: "Use for custom visualizations only"

  - finding: "visx bridges D3 power with React idioms"
    implication: "Choose for complex custom charts in React"

  - finding: "ECharts supports WebGL for massive datasets"
    implication: "Best for 10K+ data points"

recommendations:
  react_dashboards: "Recharts"
  react_custom: "visx"
  large_datasets: "ECharts or Chart.js"
  enterprise: "ECharts or Highcharts"
  low_level_custom: "D3.js"
  cross_platform: "Victory (React + React Native)"
