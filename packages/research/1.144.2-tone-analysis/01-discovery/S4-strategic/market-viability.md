**Defensibility:** **HIGH** (data compounds over time)

**Time to build:** 2-5 years (need critical mass of users)

#### Technology Moat (Moderate)
- **Proprietary models:** Custom CNN/RNN architectures
- **Tone sandhi algorithms:** Rule-based + ML hybrids

**Defensibility:** **MEDIUM** (can be replicated by competitors with ML expertise)

**Time to build:** 6-18 months (train models, optimize)

#### Brand Moat (Weak Early, Strong Later)
- **Early stage:** No strong brand (Chinese Tone Gym is best-known, but small)
- **Later stage:** First-mover advantage, word-of-mouth, reviews

**Defensibility:** **LOW to MEDIUM** (depends on user acquisition speed)

**Time to build:** 2-5 years (achieve brand recognition)

#### Regulatory Moat (Strongest for Clinical)
- **FDA/NMPA clearance:** Once cleared, competitors face same 1-3 year timeline
- **Clinical validation:** Expensive to replicate ($50K-200K per study)

**Defensibility:** **VERY HIGH** (regulatory approval is durable moat)

**Time to build:** 1-3 years (regulatory pathway)

|---------|-----|-----|---------|---------|
| **B2C (Paid ads)** | $100-400 | $60-90 | 0.15-0.9× | ❌ UNPROFITABLE |
| **B2C (Organic + SEO)** | $10-30 | $80-120 | 2.7-12× | ✅ PROFITABLE |
| **B2C (Freemium)** | $2-5 | $60-90 | 12-45× | ✅ HIGHLY PROFITABLE |
| **B2B (Enterprise)** | $5K-15K | $30K-100K | 2-20× | ✅ PROFITABLE |

- **Timeline:** 18-24 months to $1M-2M ARR
- **Risk:** Medium (need product-market fit, scalable CAC)

### Scenario 3: Clinical Focus (Long-term)
- **Budget:** $1M-3M (Series A)
