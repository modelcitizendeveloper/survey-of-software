# S3: Founders & Solo Entrepreneurs

**Persona**: Founders context-switching across product, sales, ops, fundraising
**Recommendation**: Motion ($34/month) or Reclaim + Todoist ($8-13/month)

---

## Persona Profile

**Primary needs**:
1. **Context-switch optimization**: Product → sales call → ops → fundraising (4-6 contexts/day)
2. **Project management**: Track 10-20 projects simultaneously (product roadmap, hiring, fundraising)
3. **Deadline management**: Multiple hard deadlines (investor meetings, product launches, payroll)
4. **Limited focus time**: Need to protect 5-10 hours/week for strategic work
5. **Flexibility**: Schedule changes frequently (investor calls, customer emergencies)

**Typical week**: 20h product, 10h sales/BD, 5h ops, 5h fundraising, 5h strategic planning

## Recommended: Motion ($34/month)

**Why Motion for founders**:

### 1. Project Management + Scheduling
- Track product roadmap, fundraising pipeline, hiring pipeline in one tool
- Dependencies: "Can't launch until design done" → AI schedules accordingly
- Deadline propagation: Investor demo Friday → AI works backwards, schedules prep

### 2. Context-Switching Optimization
- AI groups similar work (batch sales calls, batch product work)
- Reduces context-switching cost (fewer transitions)

### 3. Automatic Rescheduling
- Investor call pops up → AI reschedules entire week
- Founder doesn't waste time on "calendar Tetris"

**Cost justification**: $34/month = 0.7 hours saved @ $50/hour (founders save 5-10h/month)

---

## Budget Alternative: Reclaim Pro + Todoist ($8-13/month)

**Why Reclaim + Todoist**:
- Reclaim: Calendar optimization, focus time protection ($8/month)
- Todoist: Project/task management, mobile app ($5/month)
- **Total**: $13/month (62% cheaper than Motion)

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Cheaper (62% savings)
- ❌ Two tools instead of one (context-switching between Reclaim + Todoist)
- ❌ No project dependencies (simpler task model)

**When to use**: Bootstrap founders (runway-constrained), simpler projects

## Avoid: Trevor, Sunsama

**Why founders can't do daily planning**:
- Trevor/Sunsama require 10-15 min/day planning ritual
- Founders too reactive (schedule changes hourly)
- AI auto-scheduling essential (Motion/Reclaim)

---

## Key Recommendations

- **Venture-backed founders**: Motion ($34/month) - project management + AI scheduling
- **Bootstrap founders**: Reclaim Pro + Todoist ($13/month) - 62% cheaper, 80% of features
- **Solopreneurs**: Reclaim Free ($0/month) - habits + 10 tasks/week sufficient for many
