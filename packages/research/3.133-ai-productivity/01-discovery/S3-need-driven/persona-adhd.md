## Persona Profile

**Who**: Knowledge workers with ADHD, autism, or executive function challenges

**Primary needs**:
1. **External structure**: Need tool to decide "what to work on now" (reduce decision paralysis)
2. **Reduce decision fatigue**: Minimize daily planning decisions (AI autopilot)
3. **Hard deadlines enforced**: Prevent "I'll do it later" procrastination
4. **Focus time protection**: Block distractions, prevent meeting spam
5. **Visual cues**: Clear signals for task switching, time remaining

**Pain points**:
- Manual planning fails (forget to plan, planning itself overwhelming)
- Too many choices = paralysis ("I don't know where to start")
- Time blindness (underestimate duration, lose track of time)
- Hyperfocus traps (work 6 hours straight, miss meetings)
- Rejection-sensitive dysphoria (fear of missing deadlines, letting people down)

## Recommended Tool: Motion ($34/month)

**Why Motion is best for ADHD**:

### 1. Fully Automatic (Zero Daily Decisions)
- **ADHD challenge**: Daily planning = cognitive load → often skipped
- **Motion solution**: AI schedules everything automatically
- **Result**: Wake up, check calendar, AI tells you "work on Task X at 9 AM"

**Example**:
- **Without Motion**: "I have 10 tasks... which should I do first? This is overwhelming. I'll watch YouTube instead."
- **With Motion**: Calendar says "9-11 AM: Work on proposal (2h)". You just start.

---

### 2. Decision Autopilot (Eliminate "What Should I Work On?")
- **ADHD challenge**: "What should I do now?" = decision fatigue → procrastination
- **Motion solution**: AI decides priority, schedules tasks in order
- **Result**: No decisions needed, just follow the schedule

**User testimonial** (r/ADHD):
> "Motion changed my life. I used to spend 30 minutes every morning staring at my to-do list, overwhelmed. Now I just open Motion and it tells me what to do. Game-changer."

---

### 3. Hard Deadlines Enforced (No "I'll Do It Later")
- **ADHD challenge**: "I'll do it later" → task never gets done
- **Motion solution**: Deadline propagation (AI works backward from deadline, flags risk)
- **Result**: Can't procrastinate (AI schedules task early enough to meet deadline)

**Example**:
- Task: "Submit proposal" (Due: Friday 5 PM)
- Motion: Schedules "Draft proposal" on Monday, "Edit" on Tuesday, "Final review" on Thursday
- **You can't procrastinate to Friday 4 PM** (Motion blocks time Mon-Thur)

---

### 4. Focus Time Blocking (Prevent Distractions)
- **ADHD challenge**: Interruptions derail focus (hard to restart)
- **Motion solution**: AI blocks 2-4 hour "deep work" slots, marks as busy
- **Result**: Meetings can't interrupt focus time

**Settings**:
- "I need 4 hours/day of focus time"
- "Block 9 AM - 1 PM as busy (no meetings)"
- Motion: Schedules important tasks in AM, meetings in PM

---

### 5. Automatic Rescheduling (Handles Chaos)
- **ADHD challenge**: Schedule changes → manual rescheduling overwhelming → give up
- **Motion solution**: AI reschedules everything automatically when calendar changes
- **Result**: Schedule stays current, no manual "calendar Tetris"

**Example**:
- Unexpected meeting at 10 AM (blocks 2 hours of scheduled work)
- Motion: Automatically moves affected tasks to afternoon, adjusts cascade
- **You**: Do nothing, AI handles it

---

### 6. Visual Calendar View (Time Awareness)
- **ADHD challenge**: Time blindness (underestimate duration, lose track)
- **Motion solution**: Every task = visual calendar block
- **Result**: See how much time you have, when tasks end

**Visual cues**:
- 9-11 AM: "Draft proposal" (2-hour block, see it ending at 11 AM)
- 11-12 PM: "Team meeting" (1-hour block, can't run over)
- **Time remaining visible** (external timer, combats time blindness)

---

## Alternative: Reclaim.ai Pro ($8/month)

**When to choose Reclaim over Motion**:
- **Budget constraint**: $8/month vs $34/month (4× cheaper)
- **Simpler needs**: Habits (exercise, deep work) vs complex projects
- **Prefer habits**: ADHD + routine = powerful (Reclaim excels at habit scheduling)

**Reclaim strengths for ADHD**:
1. **Habit autopilot**: "Exercise 3×/week" → AI finds slots automatically
2. **Cheaper**: $8/month more sustainable long-term
3. **Focus time defense**: Protects deep work time (like Motion)
4. **Automatic rescheduling**: Moves habits when conflicts arise

**Reclaim limitations for ADHD**:
- ❌ No project dependencies (simpler task model)
- ❌ Less aggressive auto-scheduling (suggests more, decides less)
- ⚠️ Requires some daily planning (not fully autopilot like Motion)

**Verdict**: Reclaim = "Motion lite" (80% of benefits at 25% of cost)

---

## Avoid: Manual Planning Tools (Trevor, Sunsama)

**Why manual tools fail for ADHD**:

### Trevor AI
- ❌ **Daily import workflow**: Must drag tasks to calendar every morning (executive function challenge)
- ❌ **Visual overwhelm**: 20 tasks to place = decision fatigue
- ❌ **Easy to skip**: "I'll plan later" → never happens

**ADHD user feedback**:
> "Trevor looks beautiful, but I can never stick to the daily planning ritual. By day 3 I'm back to chaos."

---

### Sunsama
- ❌ **10-15 min daily planning**: Requires discipline (ADHD weakness)
- ❌ **Reflection prompts**: Cognitive load (additional decisions)
- ❌ **Mindfulness focus**: Works for neurotypical users, not ADHD

**ADHD user feedback**:
> "Sunsama's daily planning ritual is exactly what I can't do. If I could plan consistently, I wouldn't need a tool."

---

### Todoist/Things
- ❌ **Manual prioritization**: "Which task first?" = decision fatigue
- ❌ **No time blocking**: Task list only (no calendar integration)
- ❌ **No AI**: Doesn't decide for you (ADHD needs external decision-maker)

**When Todoist works for ADHD**:
- ✅ If paired with Reclaim (Todoist = task list, Reclaim = AI scheduling)
- ✅ If medication + therapy already manage executive function
- ❌ But standalone Todoist = too much manual work

## Implementation Guide for ADHD Users

### Week 1: Setup & Calibration

**Day 1-2: Initial setup** (1 hour total)
1. Sign up for Motion ($34/month) or Reclaim ($8/month)
2. Connect Google Calendar/Outlook
3. Add ALL tasks (brain dump - don't organize yet, just dump)
4. Set work hours (9 AM - 6 PM, or your actual hours)

**Day 3-7: Let AI calibrate**
- ⚠️ **Expect mediocre AI first week** (this is normal)
- Do NOT give up (ADHD trap: "This doesn't work perfectly, abandon it")
- Mark tasks as "took longer than expected" when needed (AI learns)

---

### Week 2-4: Trust Building

**ADHD challenge**: "AI scheduled this task at 3 PM, but I want to do it now"

**Solution**: Follow the schedule for 2 weeks (build trust in AI)
- AI knows: Your energy patterns, meeting density, deadline urgency
- You know: "I feel like doing this task now" (impulse)
- **Trust AI** (it's optimizing for deadline success, not immediate desire)

**Exception**: If hyperfocus kicks in, ride it (don't fight hyperfocus)

---

### Week 4+: Maintenance Mode

**Daily routine** (5-10 minutes):
1. **Morning**: Check Motion/Reclaim calendar, start first task
2. **Throughout day**: Follow schedule, mark tasks complete
3. **Evening**: Add new tasks (brain dump), let AI schedule tomorrow

**No daily planning ritual needed** (AI handles it)

## ADHD Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Software Engineer with ADHD

**Before Motion**:
- 20 tasks in Todoist, never prioritized
- Daily paralysis: "Which task first? I'll just browse Twitter."
- Missed deadlines regularly
- Constant guilt, anxiety

**After Motion** (3 months):
- Motion schedules everything automatically
- Morning routine: Open Motion, start first task (no decisions)
- Met 95% of deadlines (AI enforces hard deadlines)
- Reduced anxiety ("I trust Motion to keep me on track")

**Quote**:
> "Motion is like hiring an assistant for $34/month. It decides what I work on, when, and makes sure I don't miss deadlines. Life-changing."

---

### Case Study 2: Marketing Manager with ADHD

**Before Reclaim**:
- Calendar chaos: meetings all day, no focus time
- Tried to block focus time manually, kept getting overridden
- Exercise habit failed (never found time)

**After Reclaim** (2 months):
- Reclaim blocks 9-11 AM as "Deep work" (auto-defends from meetings)
- Exercise 3×/week scheduled automatically (AI finds slots)
- Meeting load down 20% (Reclaim suggests declining low-value meetings)

**Quote**:
> "Reclaim is my external brain. It handles the executive function stuff I'm bad at (scheduling, defending time, saying no)."

---

## Medication + Tools Synergy

**ADHD medication (stimulants)**: Helps focus once started
**AI productivity tool (Motion/Reclaim)**: Helps START (reduces decision paralysis)

**Synergy**:
1. **Medication**: Improves focus, reduces impulsivity
2. **AI tool**: Decides "what to work on now" (external structure)
3. **Result**: Medication + AI tool > either alone

**User testimonial**:
> "Medication helps me focus on a task. Motion helps me decide WHICH task. Together, they're magic."
