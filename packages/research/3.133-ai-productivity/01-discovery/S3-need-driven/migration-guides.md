# S3: Migration Guides

**Focus**: Switching between tools (Todoist → Reclaim, Motion → Reclaim, etc.)

---

## Todoist → Reclaim.ai

**Why migrate**: Add AI scheduling to existing task system
**Effort**: 15-30 minutes (no task migration needed)
**Cost**: Keep Todoist ($5/month) + add Reclaim ($8/month) = $13/month total

### Migration steps:
1. **Keep Todoist** (don't migrate tasks)
2. Connect Reclaim to Todoist (OAuth, bidirectional sync)
3. Set up Reclaim habits (exercise, deep work)
4. Reclaim pulls tasks from Todoist, schedules on calendar

**Result**: Tasks stay in Todoist (familiar interface), Reclaim handles calendar optimization

**Data loss**: None (tasks remain in Todoist)
**Switching cost**: $75-125 (30-60 min setup + 1-2 week learning curve)

---

## Motion → Reclaim.ai

**Why migrate**: Reduce cost (Reclaim $8-12/month vs Motion $34/month)
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (task export + reconfigure)
**Savings**: $22-26/month = $264-312/year

### Migration steps:
1. Export tasks from Motion (CSV)
2. Import to Todoist or keep in Reclaim directly
3. Recreate habits in Reclaim (exercise, deep work)
4. Connect Reclaim to calendar

**Data loss**:
- ❌ Project dependencies (Reclaim doesn't support)
- ❌ AI training data (2-4 week recalibration in Reclaim)
- ✅ Tasks, deadlines preserved (via CSV export)

**When to migrate**: Projects simpler (no dependencies), budget-constrained

**Switching cost**: $100-150 (2-3 hours @ $50/hour)

---

## Reclaim.ai → Motion

**Why migrate**: Need project management, more powerful AI
**Effort**: 1-2 hours (tasks may already be in Todoist, just disconnect Reclaim)
**Cost increase**: +$22-26/month ($34 Motion vs $8-12 Reclaim)

### Migration steps:
1. If tasks in Todoist: Import to Motion (CSV), disconnect Reclaim
2. If tasks in Reclaim: Export CSV, import to Motion
3. Recreate projects in Motion (add dependencies)
4. Connect Motion to calendar

**Data loss**:
- ❌ Habit history (Reclaim-specific)
- ✅ Tasks, deadlines preserved

**When to migrate**: Projects become complex (need dependencies), budget allows

**Switching cost**: $50-100 (1-2 hours @ $50/hour)

## Trevor AI → Reclaim/Motion

**Why migrate**: Reduce daily workflow time cost (Trevor = 10-15 min/day manual time blocking)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours (reconnect calendar, import tasks)
**Savings**: $1,500/year time cost (Trevor daily workflow)

### Migration steps:
1. Export tasks from Trevor (CSV)
2. Import to Reclaim or Motion
3. Delete Trevor account (stop daily manual workflow)

**Result**: AI auto-schedules (no daily time blocking needed)

**When to migrate**: Daily planning ritual unsustainable (too time-consuming)

**Switching cost**: $50-100 (1-2 hours @ $50/hour), but saves $1,500/year ongoing

---

## Sunsama → Reclaim/Motion

**Why migrate**: Reduce daily planning time cost (Sunsama = 15 min/day ritual)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Savings**: $3,000/year time cost (Sunsama daily planning)

### Migration steps:
1. Export tasks (if Sunsama stores them, or keep in Todoist/Asana)
2. Import to Reclaim or Motion
3. Delete Sunsama (stop daily planning ritual)

**When to migrate**: Daily ritual unsustainable, prefer AI autopilot

**Switching cost**: $50-100, but saves $3,000/year

## Key Recommendations

**Easiest migration**: Todoist → Reclaim (15-30 min, no data loss, tasks stay in Todoist)
**Hardest migration**: Motion → Reclaim (lose project dependencies, 2-3 hours)
**Highest ROI migration**: Trevor/Sunsama → Reclaim/Motion (save $1,500-3,000/year time cost)
**When to stay put**: If current tool works well, switching cost not worth it
