## Pricing Strategy Patterns

### Transparent Pricing (Published)

**Only**: Causal (pre-acquisition: $250/mo)
- **Strategy**: Product-led growth, self-service
- **Target**: Budget-conscious startups
- **Trade-off**: Lower revenue per customer

---

### Opaque Pricing (Custom Quotes)

**All Others**: Adaptive, Anaplan, OneStream, Planful, Prophix, Vena, Runway
- **Strategy**: Value-based pricing, maximize revenue
- **Target**: Enterprise buyers with procurement processes
- **Trade-off**: Longer sales cycles (4-12 weeks)

---

### Tiered Pricing (Good/Better/Best)

**Examples**: Vena (Professional/Complete), Planful (add-on modules)
- **Strategy**: Land-and-expand (start small, upsell later)
- **Target**: Mid-market with budget constraints
- **Trade-off**: Initial feature limitations

---

### User-Based Pricing

**Examples**: Anaplan, Adaptive, Planful, Prophix (role-based licenses)
- **Strategy**: Scale with customer growth
- **Pros**: Predictable revenue expansion
- **Cons**: Customers limit user access to control costs

---

### Unlimited User Pricing

**Examples**: Runway, Causal (pre-acquisition)
- **Strategy**: Remove adoption barriers
- **Pros**: Full team collaboration
- **Cons**: Lower revenue per customer at scale

---

## Pricing Trends (2025-2027)

### Near-Term (2025-2026)

1. **AI Premium Pricing**: Platforms will charge extra for AI features (Plan Assistant, Ambient Intelligence)
2. **Causal Price Increase**: Post-LucaNet acquisition, expect $250/mo → $10K-30K/year
3. **Consolidation Add-Ons**: Enterprise features (Planful Consolidations Premium) priced separately
4. **Transparent Pricing Pressure**: Startups demand published pricing (vs opaque quotes)

### Long-Term (2027+)

1. **Consumption-Based Pricing**: Pay per model run, per scenario, per forecast (vs flat subscription)
2. **Freemium Models**: Free tier for <10 employees, paid tiers for scale
3. **API-Based Pricing**: Charge per API call (data integrations, custom apps)
4. **Usage-Based Pricing**: Charge per active user per month (vs annual licenses)

---

## Procurement Negotiation Strategies

### Startup Negotiation Leverage

**Limited leverage** (small budget, short track record):
- **Tactics**: Annual prepayment (10-15% discount), case study participation (5-10% discount)
- **Avoid**: Multi-year lock-in (business model may change)

---

### Mid-Market Negotiation Leverage

**Moderate leverage** (larger budget, competitive bids):
- **Tactics**: Multi-vendor RFP (3-5 bids), multi-year contract (15-25% discount), reference customer (5-10% discount)
- **Ask for**: Implementation cost reduction, free training, extended support

---

### Enterprise Negotiation Leverage

**High leverage** (large budget, complex deployment):
- **Tactics**: Multi-year (3-5 year) contract (20-30% discount), volume pricing, remove implementation fees
- **Ask for**: Custom SLAs, dedicated CSM, unlimited training, free add-on modules

**Update Frequency**: Quarterly (as pricing changes, acquisitions, market shifts)

**Methodology**:
- Pricing ranges from Vendr, G2, SoftwareConnect, procurement data
- TCO scenarios modeled using industry-standard implementation costs
- Hidden costs cataloged from user reviews + consultant rates
- Cost per employee calculated from pricing ranges ÷ employee counts

**Limitations**:
- Opaque pricing = estimates only (actual quotes may vary 20-50%)
- Implementation costs depend on complexity (standard vs custom)
- Integration costs separate from FP&A subscription (often underestimated)
- Annual price increases assumed at 3-5% (SaaS market average)
