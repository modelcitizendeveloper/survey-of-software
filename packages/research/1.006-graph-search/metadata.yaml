  - "rustworkx offers best balance of performance + permissive license (Apache-2.0)"
  - "graph-tool is fastest but has high installation complexity and LGPL license"
  - "igraph is best for cross-platform projects (R integration) but lacks A*"
  - "scipy.csgraph is best for SciPy stack users but lacks A* and graph objects"
  - "Python is production tool for data science, prototyping tool for games/robotics"
  - "A* requires heuristic - not always better than Dijkstra"
  - "Performance matters less than ecosystem fit for most projects"
