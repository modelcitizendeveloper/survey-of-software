# S4 Strategic Discovery - Approach

**Phase**: S4 - Strategic/Long-term Viability Analysis
**Bead**: research-k9d (1.111 State Management Libraries)
**Date**: 2026-01-16

## Objectives

S4 evaluates libraries from a 3-5 year strategic perspective:
- Maintainer health and succession planning
- Funding sustainability
- Community trajectory
- Breaking change risk
- Migration/exit costs
- Competitive landscape evolution

## Analysis Framework

### For Each Library

1. **Maintainer Analysis**
   - Core team composition (individuals vs organizations)
   - Maintainer activity (commits, issues, PRs)
   - Succession risk (single-maintainer vs team)
   - Employment status (hobby vs funded work)

2. **Funding Assessment**
   - Revenue model (sponsorship, commercial backing, donations)
   - Sustainability indicators (GitHub Sponsors tiers, corporate backers)
   - Organizational support (Vue.js Foundation, Meta, etc.)

3. **Community Health**
   - Download trends (growth, stability, decline)
   - Contributor diversity (bus factor)
   - Ecosystem vitality (plugins, integrations, examples)
   - Community engagement (Discord, discussions, Stack Overflow)

4. **Technical Debt & Evolution**
   - Breaking change frequency
   - API stability commitment
   - React/framework version compatibility
   - Technical roadmap clarity

5. **Competitive Position**
   - Market share trends
   - Adoption by major companies
   - Influence on ecosystem (did it spawn alternatives?)
   - Positioning vs competitors
