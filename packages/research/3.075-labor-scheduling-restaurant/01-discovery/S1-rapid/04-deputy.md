## Strengths

✅ **Free tier**: 100 shifts/month (great for very small restaurants, ~8-10 employees)
✅ **Strong compliance**: Seattle Secure Scheduling Ordinance automation (best-in-class with HotSchedules)
✅ **AI scheduling**: Workforce optimization recommendations included
✅ **Web interface**: Preferred by managers for complex scheduling vs mobile-only
✅ **Affordable mid-tier**: $4.50/user cheaper than When I Work ($5/user)
✅ **31-day trial**: Longest trial period (vs 14 days for competitors)
✅ **Multi-location support**: Centralized view, location-specific rules

## Limitations

❌ **Frequent bugs/glitches**: User complaints about software stability
❌ **Slow support response**: Issue resolution takes days/weeks per users
❌ **UI complexity**: Steeper learning curve than 7shifts
❌ **Module separation**: $4.50 gets scheduling OR time tracking, not both ($9 for combined)
❌ **Limited POS integration**: Fewer integrations than HotSchedules

## Best For

- **Compliance-critical restaurants**: Seattle, SF, NYC jurisdictions (avoid $2K-10K/year violations)
- **Medium-large operations**: 30-100 employees needing AI scheduling
- **Budget $100-300/month**: Mid-tier pricing with compliance automation
- **Web-first managers**: Prefer desktop scheduling over mobile
- **Multi-location chains**: 3-10 locations with centralized management

## Not Ideal For

- Very small restaurants <8 employees (free tier sufficient, but bugs frustrate)
- Operations prioritizing software stability (user complaints about glitches)
- Teams needing fast support (slow response times reported)
- Toast POS users (Sling native integration better)
- Simple scheduling needs without compliance (7shifts easier)

## Decision Factors

**Choose Deputy if**:
- In Seattle/SF/NYC/Chicago (compliance worth $1,620/year for 30 employees)
- Need AI scheduling without enterprise cost (Deputy vs HotSchedules $3,600/year)
- 30-50 employees (pricing sweet spot vs 7shifts location-based)
- Willing to tolerate occasional bugs for compliance features
- Prefer web interface for complex scheduling

**Skip Deputy if**:
- <8 employees (free tier bugs not worth it, use 7shifts free instead)
- Prioritize software stability over features (user complaints)
- Need fast support response (<24 hours)
- Using Toast POS (Sling better)
- No compliance risks (simpler platforms sufficient)

## ROI Potential

**Compliance Violation Prevention** (Seattle):
- **Scenario**: 30-employee restaurant, Seattle Secure Scheduling Ordinance
- Typical violations without automation: 3-6/year at $500-2,000 each = $3,000-12,000/year
- Deputy prevents: 80-90% (automated 14-day lock, predictability pay, clopening)
- **Savings**: $2,400-10,800/year
- Platform cost: $1,620/year (30 employees × $4.50/mo × 12)
- **Net ROI**: $780-$9,180/year or 48-567%

**AI Scheduling Labor Optimization**:
- AI recommendations reduce overstaffing: 1-2% labor cost savings
- $1.5M revenue × 30% labor = $450K
- 1.5% savings = $6,750/year
- Platform cost: $1,620/year (already counted above)
- **Additional value**: $6,750/year on top of compliance

**Combined ROI** (Seattle, 30 employees):
- Compliance: $6,600/year (median)
- Labor optimization: $6,750/year
- **Total**: $13,350/year value
- Platform cost: $1,620/year
- **Net ROI**: $11,730/year or 724%

**Caveat**: ROI assumes compliance jurisdiction. Non-Seattle restaurants see only labor optimization ROI (~$5,130/year net, still 317%).

## Competitive Position

**vs HotSchedules**: 50% cheaper ($4.50/user vs $250/mo/location), similar compliance, weaker AI
**vs 7shifts**: Stronger compliance, similar price tier, but more bugs
**vs When I Work**: Cheaper ($4.50 vs $5/user), compliance advantage
**vs Sling**: Deputy stronger compliance, Sling better Toast integration

**Negative**:

- "$4.50 gets scheduling OR time tracking, not both (felt nickel-and-dimed)"
