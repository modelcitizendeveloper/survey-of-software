❌ **Basic forecasting**: No AI demand prediction (HotSchedules advantage)
❌ **No Toast integration**: Must use Sling for native Toast POS connection
❌ **Location-based pricing**: Expensive for multi-location vs per-user pricing (Deputy, When I Work)
❌ **Manual schedule optimization**: No auto-scheduler until Gourmet tier ($150/mo)

## Best For

- **Small single-location restaurants** (<30 employees, <$1M revenue)
- **Mobile-first operations** (employees want app-based shift management)
- **Budget-conscious** (free tier or $35/mo Entrée)
- **Tip-based service** (servers, bartenders needing automated tip distribution)
- **Quick deployment** (need scheduling working in <1 week)

## Not Ideal For

- Seattle/compliance-heavy jurisdictions (no Secure Scheduling automation)
- Multi-location chains >5 locations (location-based pricing expensive)
- Toast POS users (Sling native integration better)
- Complex forecasting needs (AI demand prediction not available until Gourmet $150/mo)
- Operations requiring offline scheduling (no offline mode)

## Decision Factors

- Need simple, fast scheduling without training burden
- Budget $35-77/month and want location-based pricing
- Tip management automation important (saves 2-3 hours/week)

**Skip 7shifts if**:
- In Seattle needing Secure Scheduling ordinance automation (use HotSchedules or Deputy)
- Using Toast POS (Sling better integration)
- >5 locations (per-user pricing cheaper: Deputy, When I Work)
- Need AI forecasting (HotSchedules or custom OR-Tools)
- Require offline scheduling capability

## ROI Potential

- 7shifts: 30 minutes/week (drag-and-drop, templates, employee self-service)
- **Savings**: 2.5-4.5 hours/week = 130-234 hours/year
- At $25/hour manager labor = **$3,250-$5,850/year**
- Platform cost: $420/year (Entrée tier)
- **Net ROI**: $2,830-$5,430/year or 674-1,293%

- Overtime alerts catch 40-hour threshold before scheduled
- Typical savings: 1-2% of labor costs (conservative vs 2-5% for AI platforms)
- $1.5M revenue × 30% labor = $450K
- 1.5% reduction = $6,750/year
- Platform cost: $420/year
- **Net ROI**: $6,330/year or 1,507%

**Tip Management** (restaurants with tipped employees):
- Manual tip calculation: 2-3 hours/week (spreadsheets, errors, disputes)
- Automated: 15 minutes/week (review only)
- Savings: 2.25 hours/week = 117 hours/year
- At $25/hour = $2,925/year
- Already included in Entrée tier ($420/year)
- **Additional value**: $2,925/year on top of scheduling ROI

**Combined ROI** (Entrée tier, small restaurant):
- Time savings: $3,250/year
- Labor optimization: $6,750/year
- Tip management: $2,925/year
- **Total value**: $12,925/year

## Competitive Position

**vs HotSchedules**: Lower cost ($35 vs $200-300/mo), easier setup, but no AI forecasting or compliance automation
**vs When I Work**: Better mobile app, free tier advantage, similar mid-tier pricing
**vs Deputy**: Easier UX, better mobile, but Deputy has stronger compliance features
**vs Sling**: Similar pricing tier, but Sling better for Toast users, 7shifts better standalone
**vs OR-Tools**: SaaS convenience vs DIY flexibility, 7shifts faster deployment
