# Word Segmentation Ambiguity

The word segmentation of Chinese expressions is difficult due to the fact that there is no word boundary in Chinese expressions and that there are some kinds of ambiguities that could result in different segmentations.

Recent work on joint word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing faces two key problems:
- Word segmentation based on character and dependency parsing based on word are not well-combined in the transition-based framework
- Current joint models suffer from insufficiency of annotated corpus
