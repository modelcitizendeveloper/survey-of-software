# Decision Framework

## Choose Cloud API When:
- Processing volume is unpredictable
- No ML/NLP expertise in-house
- Need instant scaling
- Want to avoid infrastructure management
- Prototyping or low-volume use

## Choose Self-Hosted When:
- High processing volume (cloud costs exceed self-hosting)
- Data privacy/sovereignty requirements
- Need customization or fine-tuning
- Have ML/NLP team capacity
- Long-term production use at scale
