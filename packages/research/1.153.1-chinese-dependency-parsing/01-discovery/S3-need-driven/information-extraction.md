# Information Extraction Application

Dependency parsing identifies relationships between entities in a sentence. Parsing clarifies subject–verb–object relations, improving accuracy for named-entity relation extraction.

## Example Use Case

"Apple acquired Beats for $3 billion"

The parser extracts:
- (Apple, acquired, Beats) - acquisition relationship
- (price, $3 billion) - transaction value

This structured output enables:
- Populating knowledge graphs
- Extracting business intelligence
- Building relationship databases
