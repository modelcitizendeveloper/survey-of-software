# Question Answering Application

Dependency structure helps models align question focus with candidate answers. Dependency parsers extract typed relations and generate dependency trees relating questions to passages.

## Example Use Case

"Who invented the telephone?" → Extract subject-object relations to find "Alexander Graham Bell invented telephone"

The parser identifies:
- "Who" seeks the subject
- "invented" is the verb/action
- "telephone" is the object
- Match this pattern against candidate passages
