# What is Dependency Parsing?

Dependency parsing analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying relationships between words. It focuses on determining syntactic dependencies between "head" words and the words that modify them ("dependents"), creating a tree-like structure that shows how words depend on one another to construct meaning.

Unlike constituency parsing that groups words into phrases (NP, VP, etc.), dependency parsing focuses on binary word-to-word relations, forming a directed graph.
