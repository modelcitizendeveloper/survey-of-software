# Stanford CoreNLP

Stanford CoreNLP includes a neural dependency parser that supports Chinese with CoNLL Dependencies. The parser uses a neural network classifier with three main transition types (LEFT-ARC, RIGHT-ARC, SHIFT) to build dependency trees through a linear-time scan.

A Chinese parser based on the Chinese Treebank is included in the distribution.
