# Universal Dependencies (UD)

Universal Dependencies provides standardized treebanks across languages. For Chinese, several treebanks exist:

- **Chinese-CFL**: Essays by learners of Mandarin as a foreign language (Simplified Chinese)
- **Chinese-HK**: Film subtitles and legislative proceedings from Hong Kong (Traditional Chinese)
- **Chinese-PUD**: 1000 sentences from CoNLL 2017 shared task
- **Classical Chinese**: Ancient Chinese texts annotated by Kyoto University

Cross-lingual parsers have been implemented for Chinese and 29 UD treebanks with promising results.
