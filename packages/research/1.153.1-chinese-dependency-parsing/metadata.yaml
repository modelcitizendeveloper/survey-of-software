description: |
  Comprehensive analysis of Chinese dependency parsing libraries for understanding
  grammatical relationships in Chinese text. Covers joint segmentation/parsing,
  character-level models, Universal Dependencies standard, and transformer-based
  architectures.

  total_lines: 8000
  stages_completed: [S1-rapid, S2-comprehensive, S3-need-driven, S4-strategic]

libraries_analyzed:
  - name: Stanza
    implementation: PyTorch-based, neural transformer models
    performance: High accuracy, UD-native output
    best_for: Production systems requiring UD standards, multilingual support

  - name: HanLP
    implementation: PyTorch/TensorFlow, multi-task learning
    performance: High accuracy, semantic dependencies support
    best_for: Chinese-focused projects, semantic parsing, research innovation

  - name: LTP
    implementation: PyTorch-based, Chinese-optimized
    performance: High accuracy for Chinese-only use cases
    best_for: Chinese-only projects with HIT standards preference

  - name: Stanford CoreNLP
    implementation: Java-based, pre-neural models
    performance: Mature but outdated accuracy
    best_for: Legacy system maintenance only

key_findings:
  - finding: "Joint processing combines word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing to reduce error propagation"
    impact: "Modern parsers achieve higher accuracy by avoiding cascading errors from separate pipeline stages"

  - finding: "Character-level models bypass word segmentation bottlenecks"
    impact: "Recent approaches eliminate dependency on word segmentation, improving robustness on ambiguous text"

  - finding: "Universal Dependencies (UD) is becoming the dominant standard"
    impact: "UD-aligned tools (Stanza, HanLP) are future-proof as standard gains cross-linguistic adoption"

  - finding: "Transformer models (BERT-based) dominate modern parsing"
    impact: "Pre-neural tools (CoreNLP) are obsolete for new projects; PyTorch-based parsers integrate latest models"

  - finding: "LLMs don't yet replace dedicated parsers for production"
    impact: "Hybrid pattern: LLMs for reasoning, parsers for structured extraction at scale"

recommendations:
  default: "Use Stanza for most production systems due to institutional stability, UD standards, and multilingual support"

  by_use_case:
    production_systems: "Stanza - Stanford-backed, UD-native, lowest long-term risk"
    chinese_focused_projects: "HanLP or LTP - optimized for Chinese, semantic dependencies support"
    research_innovation: "HanLP - latest architectures, semantic parsing, active development"
    multilingual_requirements: "Stanza or HanLP - 80-130+ languages vs LTP's Chinese-only"
    legacy_maintenance: "CoreNLP - only for maintaining existing systems, not new projects"

  strategic_guidance:
    safest_choice: "Stanza (90% confidence viable through 2031)"
    innovation_choice: "HanLP (75% confidence viable through 2031)"
    chinese_only_choice: "LTP (60% confidence viable through 2031)"
    avoid_for_new_projects: "CoreNLP (end-of-life, maintenance mode)"
