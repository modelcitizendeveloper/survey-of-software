# S3 NEED-DRIVEN: Approach

**Experiment**: 1.171 Sentence Alignment
**Pass**: S3 - Need-Driven Discovery
**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Target Duration**: 1-2 hours

## Objective

Practical implementation guides for common sentence alignment scenarios, with complete workflows from raw data to production deployment.

## Scenarios in Scope

1. **Building MT Training Data** (Large Scale)
2. **Multilingual Content Management** (CMS Integration)
3. **Translation Quality Assessment** (Research/Audit)
4. **Web-Crawled Corpus Creation** (Noisy Data)

## Research Method

For each scenario, document:
- **Context**: When you need this, what you're starting with
- **Tool selection**: Which aligner(s) to use and why
- **Step-by-step workflow**: Complete implementation guide
- **Code examples**: Copy-paste ready scripts
- **Quality checks**: Validation and error handling
- **Production considerations**: Scaling, monitoring, maintenance

## Success Criteria

- Complete runnable examples for each scenario
- Clear decision criteria for tool selection
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Performance benchmarks for realistic workloads
- Cost estimates (time, compute, money)
