# S1 RAPID DISCOVERY: Approach

**Experiment**: 1.171 Sentence Alignment
**Pass**: S1 - Rapid Discovery
**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Target Duration**: 20-30 minutes

## Objective

Quick assessment of 3 leading sentence alignment tools to identify their core strengths, basic performance characteristics, and primary use cases for aligning parallel sentences in bilingual corpora.

## Libraries in Scope

1. **Hunalign** - Fast dictionary-based alignment using Gale-Church algorithm
2. **Bleualign** - BLEU metric-based alignment for machine translation corpora
3. **vecalign** - Multilingual embedding-based alignment from Facebook AI

## Research Method

For each library, capture:
- **What it is**: Brief description and origin
- **Key characteristics**: Core features and alignment algorithm
- **Speed**: Basic performance metrics
- **Accuracy**: Published benchmarks if available
- **Ease of use**: Installation and basic API
- **Maintenance**: Activity level and backing organization

## Success Criteria

- Identify each library's primary strength/differentiator
- Create quick comparison table
- Provide initial recommendation for common use cases
