# S4-Strategic: Long-Term Viability Analysis

## Objective

Evaluate **long-term strategic decisions** for UI component libraries: vendor stability, ecosystem health, migration costs, and technology trends. This pass informs which libraries are safe bets for 3-5+ year commitments.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Vendor Stability
- **Backing**: Company-backed vs community-maintained
- **Funding**: Revenue model, investor backing
- **Track record**: Years in production, major versions
- **Bus factor**: Single maintainer vs team

### 2. Ecosystem Health
- **Adoption**: GitHub stars, npm downloads
- **Community**: Discord activity, GitHub issues response time
- **Third-party**: Plugins, templates, tutorials
- **Jobs market**: Demand for library skills

### 3. Technology Trends
- **Industry direction**: CSS-in-JS vs static CSS
- **Framework evolution**: React 19+, Server Components
- **Styling paradigms**: Tailwind dominance, utility-first
- **Accessibility**: Legal requirements increasing

### 4. Migration Costs
- **Lock-in depth**: How hard to migrate away?
- **Upgrade path**: Breaking changes between majors
- **Codemod support**: Automated migration tools
- **Alternative compatibility**: Can swap incrementally?

## What S4 Covers

**Long-term bets**: Which libraries will exist in 5 years?
**Technology alignment**: Which match future trends?
**Risk assessment**: What could go wrong?
**Exit strategy**: How hard to migrate if needed?
