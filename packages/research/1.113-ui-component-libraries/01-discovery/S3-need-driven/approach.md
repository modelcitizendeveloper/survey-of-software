# S3-Need-Driven: Use Case & Persona Analysis

## Objective

Identify **WHO needs UI component libraries** and **WHY** they need them, focusing on real-world user personas and their pain points. This pass examines use cases, not implementations.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Persona Identification
- **Role**: Developer role, team size, company context
- **Pain points**: What problems do they face?
- **Goals**: What are they trying to achieve?
- **Constraints**: Time, budget, team skills, requirements

### 2. Decision Factors
- **Technical context**: Existing stack, team skills
- **Business context**: Timeline, budget, maintenance capacity
- **Project type**: Consumer app, enterprise dashboard, design system
- **Requirements**: Accessibility, performance, customization

### 3. Success Criteria
- **Time to market**: How quickly can they ship?
- **Maintenance burden**: Ongoing cost of ownership
- **User experience**: Quality of final product
- **Team velocity**: Developer productivity

## Personas Covered

Each use case file examines a specific persona:

1. **Startup founder** - Ship MVP fast with limited resources
2. **Enterprise frontend team** - Build data-heavy admin panels
3. **Design system team** - Create custom component library for organization
4. **Solo freelancer** - Build custom client sites quickly
5. **Open-source maintainer** - Build accessible tools for community

## What S3 Does NOT Cover

- Implementation details (HOW to use libraries)
- Code examples (save for documentation)
- Technical architecture (covered in S2)
- Long-term strategic decisions (covered in S4)

## Deliverables

- `use-case-<persona>.md` for each persona (5 files)
- `recommendation.md` mapping personas to libraries
