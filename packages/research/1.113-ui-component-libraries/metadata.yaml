notes: "UI Component Libraries - React/Vue component systems including MUI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Mantine, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Headless UI. Comprehensive analysis of pre-styled vs headless approaches."

summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of seven major UI component libraries (shadcn/ui, MUI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Mantine, Radix UI, Headless UI). Research covers architecture patterns (pre-styled vs headless, CSS-in-JS vs utility CSS), accessibility implementation, bundle size optimization, developer experience, long-term viability, and strategic recommendations. Key finding: Three distinct approaches - full design systems (MUI, Ant), customizable prop-based (Chakra, Mantine), and headless primitives (Radix, Headless UI), plus emerging copy-paste model (shadcn/ui). Strategic recommendation: shadcn/ui for modern Tailwind stacks (fastest growth, you own code), Radix UI for headless needs (WorkOS-backed, powers shadcn), MUI/Ant Design for enterprise 10-year horizons (company backing, proven scale).
