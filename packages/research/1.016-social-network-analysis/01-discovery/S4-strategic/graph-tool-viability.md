# graph-tool - Strategic Viability

## Sustainability: Moderate

**Governance**: Single-maintainer academic project (Tiago Peixoto)
- Bus factor = 1 (major risk)
- No foundation backing
- Dependent on academic position continuity

**Development**: Active but concentrated
- Single primary developer
- Regular updates
- Cutting-edge research methods

**Longevity**: Moderate concern
- 15+ year track record
- Maintainer academically productive
- Risk if maintainer changes priorities

**Risk**: Moderate - exceptional quality, but single-maintainer dependency

## Ecosystem Position: Specialist

**Adoption**: Strong in computational science
- Network science labs: High
- Biology/physics: Moderate-high
- Industry: Low (installation friction, LGPL)

**Momentum**: Stable in niche
- Academic citations growing
- Industry adoption limited
- Unique algorithms (SBM) drive continued relevance

**Competitive position**: Unmatched for advanced methods
- SBM community detection: No alternatives
- Performance: Best in class
- But niche positioning limits broad adoption

## Future Flexibility: Moderate

**Migration paths**:
- From NetworkX/igraph: High effort (property maps)
- To alternatives: Difficult (SBM unique)
- Lock-in risk if depend on unique methods

**LGPL considerations**:
- Dynamic linking acceptable for most
- Derivatives must be LGPL
- Commercial use requires legal review

## Team Evolution: Specialist Teams Only

**Skill building**: High expertise required
- Boost property maps: Steep learning curve
- Advanced graph theory: PhD-level helpful
- Limited Stack Overflow resources

**Hiring**: Difficult
- Very small talent pool with experience
- Must train from scratch usually
- "graph-tool expert" rare job requirement

**Career value**: Academic/research niche
- Valued in computational science
- Less recognized in industry
- Specialist expertise, not general skill

## Strategic Considerations

### 3-5 Year Outlook: Uncertain

**Best case**: Maintainer continues, community grows
**Likely case**: Stable niche tool for specialists
**Worst case**: Maintenance pauses, community forks or migrates

**Risks**: High
- **Bus factor**: Single maintainer
- **Organizational**: Academic funding cycles
- **Ecosystem**: Python packaging evolving (Conda dependency risky)

### Investment Protection: Risky

**Code longevity**: 3-5 years likely, 10+ uncertain
**Skill longevity**: Specialist knowledge, transferability limited
**Exit costs**: High (unique methods, complex API)

## Recommendation: Specialist Only

**Choose strategically when**:
- Absolutely need SBM or unique methods
- Have PhD-level team comfortable with complexity
- Academic/research context (maintenance risk acceptable)
- Can fork/maintain if needed (C++ expertise available)

**Avoid strategically when**:
- Team lacks advanced expertise
- Commercial product (bus factor unacceptable)
- Need long-term stability guarantees
- Prefer low-risk dependencies

**High reward, high risk**: Exceptional capabilities, but sustainability concerns.
