# snap.py - Strategic Viability

## Sustainability: Moderate Concern

**Governance**: Academic lab (Stanford InfoLab)
- University-backed (stable institution)
- But academic project lifecycle risk
- Development pace slowed in recent years

**Development**: Slow/maintenance mode
- Fewer updates than peak years
- Still maintained, but not active development
- Community contributions limited

**Longevity**: Uncertain
- 15+ year track record
- Used in published research (incentive to maintain)
- Risk of becoming "done" project (no new features)

**Risk**: Moderate - proven technology, but slow evolution

## Ecosystem Position: Niche (Billion-Scale)

**Adoption**: Low outside research
- Academic: Citations for billion-node papers
- Industry: Rare (Google, Facebook scale companies)
- Most users: Too small for SNAP, use alternatives

**Momentum**: Declining
- Peak interest 2010-2015
- Alternatives (graph-tool, NetworKit) gaining ground
- Still cited in research, but less new adoption

**Competitive threats**: High
- NetworKit: Better parallelism, active development
- graph-tool: Faster, more algorithms
- SNAP's niche (billion-node, Python) shrinking

## Future Flexibility: Moderate

**Migration paths**:
- To graph-tool/NetworKit: Moderate effort
- From NetworkX: Moderate (SWIG API different)

**Lock-in**: Low
- Standard algorithms, portable data
- BSD license (permissive)
- SNAP datasets valuable independently

## Team Evolution: Specialist Risk

**Skill building**: Limited career value
- SWIG API not transferable
- Declining momentum limits job market
- Billion-scale expertise niche

**Hiring**: Very difficult
- Tiny talent pool
- Must train from scratch
- "SNAP expert" not a job requirement

## Strategic Considerations

### 3-5 Year Outlook: Maintenance Mode Likely

**Risks**:
- Development pace continuing to slow
- Alternatives (NetworKit) better for most billion-scale needs
- Academic funding cycles uncertain

### Recommendation: Avoid Unless Specific Need

**Choose strategically ONLY when**:
- Replicating Stanford research (SNAP datasets)
- Proven billion-node need AND alternatives insufficient
- Team already expert in SNAP

**Prefer alternatives**:
- **NetworKit**: Better parallelism, active development, similar scale
- **graph-tool**: More algorithms, faster, better maintained

**Investment risk**: High - slow development suggests declining strategic focus.
