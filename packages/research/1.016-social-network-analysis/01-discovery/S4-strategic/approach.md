# S4-Strategic: Social Network Analysis Libraries

## Research Approach

**Question**: Which library choice best serves long-term strategic goals?

**Philosophy**: Think beyond immediate needs - consider maintenance burden, ecosystem evolution, team growth, vendor risk, and multi-year architectural decisions.

**Methodology**:
1. Analyze library governance and sustainability
2. Evaluate ecosystem positioning and momentum
3. Assess vendor/dependency risk
4. Project future team and scale requirements
5. Consider strategic flexibility and migration paths

**Output**: Strategic insights for multi-year library choices
