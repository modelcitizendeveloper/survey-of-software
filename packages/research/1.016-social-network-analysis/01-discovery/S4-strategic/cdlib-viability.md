# CDlib - Strategic Viability

## Sustainability: Moderate

**Governance**: Academic lab (KDDLab, University of Pisa)
- Small team
- Active research group
- Publication-driven development

**Development**: Active, focused
- Regular updates
- Growing algorithm coverage
- Responsive to community

**Longevity**: Moderate confidence
- Newer project (2019)
- Track record short but solid
- Depends on continued research funding

**Risk**: Moderate - young project, small team, but active

## Ecosystem Position: Complementary

**Adoption**: Growing in research
- Community detection researchers: High
- General users: Low (specialized use case)
- ~30K monthly downloads

**Momentum**: Positive
- Filling real gap (unified community detection interface)
- Academic citations growing
- Complements rather than competes with general libraries

**Competitive position**: Unique niche
- No direct competitors for comprehensive community detection wrapper
- Value depends on backend libraries (NetworkX, igraph, graph-tool)
- Sustainable as long as backends exist

## Future Flexibility: Excellent

**Migration paths**: N/A (wrapper, not replacement)
- Use alongside any backend
- Easy to add/remove from stack
- No lock-in

**Lock-in**: Zero
- Thin wrapper over backends
- Can always use backends directly
- BSD license (permissive)

## Team Evolution: Research Focus

**Skill building**: Community detection specialist
- Niche but valuable expertise
- Research methods understanding
- Transferable to backend libraries

**Hiring**: Easy (if team knows backends)
- Learn CDlib quickly if know NetworkX/igraph
- API simple, documentation good
- Specialist knowledge not required

**Career value**: Research niche
- Valued in community detection research
- Less relevant for general engineering
- Academic context mainly

## Strategic Considerations

### 3-5 Year Outlook: Stable Niche

**Likely trajectory**:
- Continued algorithm additions
- Remain research/evaluation tool
- Dependent on backend library health

**Risks**: Low-moderate
- Backend dependency (if NetworkX/igraph/graph-tool decline, CDlib affected)
- Small team (bus factor moderate)
- Research funding cycles

### Investment Protection: Low Risk

**Code longevity**: 3-5 years likely
**Skill longevity**: Backend skills more valuable than CDlib-specific
**Exit costs**: Zero (can stop using anytime, use backends directly)

## Recommendation: Low-Risk Addition

**Choose strategically when**:
- Community detection is core research focus
- Need to systematically compare algorithms
- Want evaluation framework for method validation
- Backend library already chosen

**Strategic value**:
- Complements, doesn't replace
- Minimal investment (easy to learn)
- Easy to add/remove (no lock-in)
- Provides value if community detection matters

**Not strategic choice alone**: Always paired with backend library decision.

**Low risk, moderate reward**: Safe to adopt, valuable for niche use case, easy to abandon if not needed.
