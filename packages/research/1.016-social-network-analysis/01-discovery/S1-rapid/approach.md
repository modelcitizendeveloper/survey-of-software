# S1-Rapid: Social Network Analysis Libraries

## Research Approach

**Question**: Which social network analysis library should I use?

**Philosophy**: Popular libraries exist for a reason - they've been battle-tested by thousands of users. S1 focuses on rapid discovery through ecosystem signals, community metrics, and high-level feature comparisons.

**Methodology**:
1. Identify major libraries through GitHub stars, PyPI downloads, academic citations
2. Extract key differentiators: performance, scalability, algorithm coverage
3. Present comparison tables for quick decision-making
4. Focus on "WHICH library?" not "HOW to use?"

**Output**: Decision-focused comparison guide (5-10 minute read)

## Libraries Covered

1. **NetworkX** - Pure Python, general-purpose, educational
2. **igraph** - C core, Python bindings, performance-focused
3. **graph-tool** - C++ core, scientific computing, massive graphs
4. **snap.py** - Stanford's library, billion-node graphs
5. **CDlib** - Community detection specialist
6. **NetworKit** - Parallel processing, extreme performance

## Key Decision Factors

- **Graph size**: Thousands vs millions vs billions of nodes
- **Performance needs**: Prototyping vs production analysis
- **Algorithm coverage**: General-purpose vs specialized (community detection)
- **Ease of use**: Learning curve, documentation quality
- **Ecosystem maturity**: Maintenance, community support

## S1 Constraints

✅ **Included**: Stats, benchmarks, pros/cons, feature comparisons
❌ **Excluded**: Installation guides, code samples, usage tutorials

This is a shopping comparison, not a manual.
