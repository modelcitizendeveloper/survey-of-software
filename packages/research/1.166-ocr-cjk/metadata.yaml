  Comprehensive analysis of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) libraries for Chinese,
  Japanese, and Korean (CJK) languages. Covers text recognition for printed documents,
  handwritten text, and scene text (photos of signs, products). Includes deep analysis
  of Tesseract (mature standard), PaddleOCR (Chinese-optimized), and EasyOCR (multi-

  - name: PaddleOCR
    implementation: Deep learning (detection + recognition pipeline)
    performance: "20-50ms with GPU, 1-2s with CPU"
    accuracy: "96-99% printed, 85-92% handwritten CJK"
    best_for: Chinese-primary, highest accuracy, production systems
    maturity: "4+ years, Baidu-sponsored, active development"

    best_for: Multi-language, scene text, PyTorch projects
    maturity: "4+ years, Jaided AI (startup), active development"

key_findings:
  - finding: "CJK OCR is significantly harder than Latin scripts due to character density (10,000+ unique symbols vs 26 letters)"
    impact: "Requires specialized models; generic Latin OCR models fail on CJK"

  - finding: "PaddleOCR achieves 96-99% accuracy on printed Chinese, best-in-class for CJK"
    impact: "Recommended default for Chinese-primary applications"

  - finding: "Scene text (photos) requires different optimization than document text (scans)"
    impact: "EasyOCR excels at scene text (90-95%), Tesseract struggles (<70%)"

  - finding: "Handwriting recognition remains challenging: 70-92% accuracy at best"
    impact: "Always requires human review workflow; not reliable for full automation"

  - finding: "Self-hosting justified at >50,000 images/month; below that, commercial APIs cheaper"

completion_notes: |
  Completed February 6, 2026. Comprehensive analysis of CJK OCR libraries covering
  the unique challenges of Chinese/Japanese/Korean character recognition (10,000+
  unique symbols, similar character shapes, handwriting complexity).

  Key strategic insight: OCR is transitioning from specialized tools to commodity
  foundation model capability (2027-2030). Current choices should prioritize
  migration flexibility via abstraction layers and multi-vendor strategies.

  Critical finding: Self-hosting economics favor commercial APIs below 50K images/
  month, but shift dramatically above that threshold due to fixed infrastructure
  costs vs linear API fees. Hybrid strategies (start API, migrate self-hosted)
  provide best risk-adjusted path.

  Practical impact: Research provides concrete guidance for build vs buy decisions,
  including TCO calculations, break-even analysis, and migration strategies. Healthcare
  ROI example shows 650% return with 2-month payback on 1,000 forms/day workflow.

  Long-term trends: Multi-modal foundation models (GPT-4V successors) will likely
  commoditize OCR by 2027-2030. Standalone OCR tools will remain relevant only for
  privacy-critical, offline, or extreme-scale use cases. Organizations should
  architect for easy migration to vision-language APIs.
