completion_notes: |
  Completed January 29, 2026. Research demonstrates that PaddleOCR (Baidu-developed,
  free) often outperforms Western commercial APIs for Chinese text despite being
  open source, due to CJK-specific optimization.

  Key strategic insight: CJK OCR is qualitatively different from Latin OCR due to
  100,000+ character classes and lack of word boundaries. Generic OCR systems tuned
  for alphabetic languages underperform significantly (87% vs 96%+ accuracy).

  Critical finding: Preprocessing (deskew, denoise, contrast adjustment) provides
  80% of accuracy gains - more impactful than model choice. The 95% accuracy barrier
  is real: last 5% as hard as first 90%, budget accordingly.

  Practical impact: Break-even analysis shows commercial APIs cost-effective for
  <100K pages/year, while self-hosted PaddleOCR wins at higher volumes. For
  compliance-critical use cases, ABBYY/Google offer 99%+ accuracy with audit trails.

  DOMAIN_EXPLAINER provides accessible introduction to CJK OCR challenges using
  universal analogies (library organization, items without separators), making
  research accessible to non-specialists while maintaining technical accuracy.
