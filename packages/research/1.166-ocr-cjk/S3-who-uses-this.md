## Who Shouldn't Use This

**You don't need CJK-specific OCR if**:
- You only process Latin alphabet languages
- Your documents are already born-digital (no scanning needed)
- You have very low volume (manual entry is faster)
- Your use case is purely English or other Latin-based languages

**Warning signs you need CJK OCR**:
- Processing any Chinese, Japanese, or Korean documents
- Handling multilingual documents mixing CJK and Latin scripts
- Dealing with vertical text layouts (Japanese)
- Working with historical or handwritten CJK text
- Processing government forms, IDs, or official documents from Asian countries
