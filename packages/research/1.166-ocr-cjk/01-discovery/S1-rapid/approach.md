# S1-Rapid: Quick Exploration Approach

## Objective
Rapidly identify the main OCR libraries for CJK text recognition and their basic capabilities.

## Scope
Focus on the three most commonly referenced OCR tools with documented CJK support:
- Tesseract (with chi_sim and chi_tra models)
- PaddleOCR
- EasyOCR

## Method
1. Review official documentation for CJK model availability
2. Identify key differences in approach (traditional ML vs deep learning)
3. Note installation complexity and dependencies
4. Quick scan of reported accuracy for Chinese text

## Time Box
2-3 hours maximum for initial exploration

## Outputs
- Brief overview of each library (1-2 pages each)
- Quick comparison matrix
- Preliminary recommendation based on ease of setup vs accuracy claims
