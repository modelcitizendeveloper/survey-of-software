  Comprehensive analysis of Chinese tokenization libraries and approaches for
  NLP preprocessing. Covers character-level vs word-level vs subword tokenization,
  segmentation algorithms, neural approaches, and modern transformer tokenizers.

  stages_completed: [S1-rapid, S2-comprehensive, S3-need-driven, S4-strategic, DOMAIN_EXPLAINER]

libraries_analyzed:
  - name: Jieba
    implementation: Dictionary + HMM hybrid
    performance: Fast (400 KB/s), moderate accuracy (F1 ~85%)
    best_for: Prototyping, keyword extraction, search systems

  - name: PKUSEG
    implementation: Neural network (BiLSTM-CRF), domain-specific models
    performance: Highest accuracy (F1 ~96%) among traditional tools
    best_for: Domain-specific production systems (news, web, medicine)

  - name: LAC
    implementation: Neural network (BiGRU-CRF), joint processing
    performance: Best speed + accuracy combo (800 QPS, F1 > 0.91)
    best_for: Production Chinese-only systems with POS/NER requirements

  - name: bert-base-chinese
    implementation: Character-level transformer tokenization
    performance: High accuracy, zero OOV, battle-tested
    best_for: Building Chinese-only transformer models

  - name: SentencePiece
    implementation: Unigram language model, language-independent
    performance: Balanced accuracy, handles OOV well
    best_for: Multilingual systems, custom transformer models

  - name: spaCy
    implementation: Multilingual NLP framework (uses pkuseg backend)
    performance: Good accuracy (F1 ~94.6%)
    best_for: Multilingual pipelines with unified API

  - name: HuggingFace Tokenizers
    implementation: Pre-trained transformer tokenizers (Qwen, ChatGLM)
    performance: Chinese-optimized for specific models
    best_for: Using pre-trained Chinese models

key_findings:
  - finding: "Chinese has no word boundaries - tokenization is non-trivial preprocessing"
    impact: "Wrong tokenization cascades through all NLP tasks (7-8 BLEU points in MT)"

  - finding: "Three paradigms: character-level (no segmentation), word-level (requires dictionary), subword (data-driven)"
    impact: "Character-level dominates modern neural NLP (BERT approach) due to zero segmentation errors"

  - finding: "Byte-level BPE inflates Chinese text 2-3x"
    impact: "SentencePiece Unigram with explicit CJK support is gold standard for Chinese subword tokenization"

  - finding: "Joint processing (segmentation + POS + parsing) reduces error propagation"
    impact: "Modern tools like LAC perform joint tasks for higher accuracy in production"

  - finding: "Segmentation ambiguity is inherent - same text can have multiple valid segmentations"
    impact: "Context-dependent tokenization (transformers with attention) handles ambiguity better than fixed dictionaries"

recommendations:
  default: "Use bert-base-chinese (character-level) for most transformer-based NLP tasks - battle-tested, zero OOV, widely supported"

  by_use_case:
    prototyping: "Jieba - fastest setup, good enough accuracy for experimentation"
    production_accuracy: "LAC or PKUSEG - highest accuracy among traditional tools, fast enough for production"
    multilingual: "SentencePiece Unigram - language-independent, proven in T5/XLNet/mT5"
    transformer_models: "bert-base-chinese (Chinese-only) or SentencePiece (multilingual)"
    search_ir: "Jieba search mode or character n-grams"

  strategic_guidance:
    safest_choice: "bert-base-chinese (95% confidence viable through 2030 - Google/BERT standard)"
    production_choice: "LAC or PKUSEG (85% confidence viable through 2029 - active maintenance)"
    innovation_choice: "SentencePiece or HuggingFace Tokenizers (90% confidence - active ecosystem)"
    avoid_for_new_projects: "Fixed dictionary approaches without neural backup (outdated)"
