# S2: Comprehensive Analysis - Approach

**Goal:** Deep dive into features, pricing, integrations, and capabilities across all accounting platforms

**Time Budget:** 3-4 hours

**Methodology:**
1. Create comprehensive feature comparison matrices
2. Analyze total cost of ownership (TCO) across different scenarios
3. Document integration ecosystems and API capabilities
4. Compare implementation requirements and scalability
5. Synthesize findings into strategic recommendations

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Feature Comparison Matrix
**Compare across all 8 platforms:**
- Core accounting (GL, AP, AR, bank reconciliation)
- Financial reporting (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, custom reports)
- Invoicing and billing (recurring, estimates, payment collection)
- Expense tracking and management
- Inventory management (COGS, multi-location, variants)
- Project and job costing
- Time tracking
- Multi-currency support
- Multi-entity consolidation
- Tax compliance and preparation
- Payroll integration/features
- Mobile capabilities
- User management and permissions
- Audit trails and compliance
- Automation capabilities

### 2. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
**Analyze real costs for different business scenarios:**
- Small business (5 users, $500K revenue)
- Growing business (15 users, $5M revenue)
- Mid-market (50 users, $25M revenue)

**Cost components:**
- Subscription fees (monthly/annual)
- User licenses (additional users)
- Add-on modules and features
- Payment processing fees
- Payroll fees
- Implementation costs
- Training costs
- Accountant/bookkeeper fees
- Migration costs (from previous system)
- Year 1 total vs Years 2-5

### 3. Integration Ecosystem
**Evaluate integration capabilities:**
- Banking integrations (Plaid, direct bank connections)
- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
- E-commerce (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce)
- Payroll (Gusto, ADP, Paylocity)
- CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho CRM)
- Time tracking (Harvest, Toggl, TSheets)
- Expense management (Expensify, Divvy)
- Inventory management (Shopify, TradeGecko)
- Project management (Asana, Monday.com)
- Tax compliance (Avalara, TaxJar)
- Marketplace/app stores
- API availability (REST, webhooks)
- Custom integration capabilities

### 4. Implementation & Scalability
**Assess setup and growth requirements:**
- Setup time (DIY vs professional services)
- Data migration complexity
- Training requirements (hours per user)
- Implementation costs (small, medium, large deployments)
- User limits (minimum, maximum)
- Transaction limits
- Entity limits
- Storage limits
- Performance at scale
- When you outgrow the platform
- Migration difficulty (exit strategy)

### 5. Industry-Specific Features
**Evaluate vertical capabilities:**
- Professional services (time & materials, project accounting)
- SaaS/subscription businesses (recurring revenue, MRR/ARR, ASC 606)
- E-commerce (inventory, COGS, sales channels)
- Restaurants (POS integration, inventory, job costing)
- Construction (job costing, progress billing, retainage)
- Nonprofits (fund accounting, grants, donor management)
- Manufacturing (BOM, work orders, production costing)
