## Quick Decision Guide

### By Business Size

**Micro Business (<$100K revenue, 1-5 employees)**
→ **Wave (Free)** or **QuickBooks Solopreneur ($20/mo)**
- Start with Wave for truly minimal needs
- Upgrade to QuickBooks Solopreneur if need better support/features

**Small Business ($100K-$5M revenue, 5-50 employees)**
→ **QuickBooks Online ($38-85/mo)** or **Xero ($20-80/mo)**
- QuickBooks if US-based, need inventory, work with US accountants
- Xero if international, need unlimited users, want modern UX

**Service Business (Freelancers, Consultants, Agencies)**
→ **FreshBooks ($19-60/mo)** or **QuickBooks Online**
- FreshBooks best for time tracking and project billing
- QuickBooks if need more comprehensive accounting

**Budget-Conscious Small Business**
→ **Zoho Books ($15-70/mo)** or **Wave Pro ($16/mo)**
- Zoho Books if using Zoho ecosystem
- Wave Pro if just need automation on free base

**Growing Business ($5M-$20M revenue, 20-100 employees)**
→ **Sage Intacct** or stay with **QuickBooks/Xero Plus tiers**
- Sage Intacct if multi-entity, need advanced reporting
- Stay with QuickBooks/Xero if simple structure works

**Mid-Market ($20M-$100M revenue, 100-500 employees)**
→ **Sage Intacct** or **NetSuite**
- Sage Intacct if accounting-focused (professional services, SaaS)
- NetSuite if need full ERP (manufacturing, e-commerce, inventory)

**Microsoft Ecosystem Users**
→ **Dynamics 365 Business Central**
- Best fit if already on Office 365, Azure, Power Platform
- Don't choose solely for accounting (Sage Intacct better)

## Decision Trees

### Tree 1: Free vs Paid

```
Q: What's your annual revenue?

<$50K revenue
→ Wave Free
  → Need automation? Upgrade to Wave Pro ($16/mo)
  → Outgrowing? Move to QuickBooks/Xero

$50K-$500K revenue
→ QuickBooks Simple Start ($38/mo) or Xero Early ($20/mo)
  → QuickBooks if US-based, familiar to your accountant
  → Xero if international or need unlimited users

$500K+ revenue
→ Full-featured accounting platform required
  → See Tree 2
```

### Tree 2: Small Business Choice (QuickBooks vs Xero vs FreshBooks)

```
Q: What's your primary business model?

Service-based (consulting, law, design, marketing)
→ FreshBooks ($19-60/mo)
  → Best time tracking, proposals, project management
  → Limitation: No inventory management

Product-based (inventory/COGS tracking needed)
→ QuickBooks Plus ($85/mo)
  → Best inventory features in small business category
  → Alternative: Xero Established if international

Multi-location or international
→ Xero ($20-80/mo)
  → Unlimited users on all plans
  → Strong multi-currency support
  → Alternative: QuickBooks if US-centric

Team collaboration (5-25 users)
→ Xero ($20-80/mo)
  → Unlimited users is killer feature
  → Alternative: QuickBooks Advanced for 25 users ($275/mo)

US-based with established accountant
→ QuickBooks Online ($38-85/mo)
  → Most accountants know QuickBooks
  → Largest ecosystem and support
```

### Tree 3: When to Graduate to Mid-Market

```
Q: Are you experiencing these pain points?

Multi-entity consolidation is painful (3+ entities)
+ Need better financial reporting/dashboards
+ Revenue $5M-$100M
+ 20-500 employees
→ Consider Sage Intacct or NetSuite

PLUS: Need full ERP (manufacturing, inventory depth, e-commerce)
→ NetSuite or Dynamics 365 Business Central
  → NetSuite if e-commerce/multi-subsidiary focus
  → Dynamics if Microsoft ecosystem

ACCOUNTING-FOCUSED: Don't need full ERP
→ Sage Intacct
  → Best mid-market accounting platform
  → Professional services, SaaS, nonprofits excel here

MICROSOFT USERS: Already on Office 365, Azure, Power Platform
→ Dynamics 365 Business Central
  → Best fit for Microsoft-centric organizations
  → Not ideal if accounting is 80%+ of use case
```

## Red Flags: When to Avoid

**Avoid Wave if:**
- Revenue >$100K or growing fast
- Need inventory management
- Require advanced reporting
- Accountant requires QuickBooks/Xero

**Avoid FreshBooks if:**
- You're a product business (no inventory)
- Need robust financial reporting
- Have complex accounting needs beyond billable hours

**Avoid QuickBooks if:**
- Operating outside North America primarily
- Unlimited users is critical (Xero better)
- Want to avoid price increases (frequent)

**Avoid Xero if:**
- Your US accountant insists on QuickBooks
- Need best-in-class inventory management (QuickBooks Plus better)

**Avoid Sage Intacct if:**
- Revenue <$4M (too expensive for small business)
- Need full ERP features (manufacturing, supply chain)

**Avoid NetSuite if:**
- Just need accounting (Sage Intacct better value)
- Budget <$50K/year
- Can't invest in 6-12 month implementation

**Avoid Dynamics 365 if:**
- Not using Microsoft ecosystem (value diminishes)
- Pure accounting focus (Sage Intacct better)

## Migration Paths

**Typical progression:**

```
Wave/Spreadsheets
  ↓
QuickBooks/Xero/FreshBooks
  ↓
Sage Intacct (if accounting-focused)
  OR
NetSuite/Dynamics 365 (if need full ERP)
  ↓
SAP/Oracle ERP Cloud (enterprise)
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Staying too long in Wave (revenue >$100K, pain points accumulating)
- Choosing full ERP when you only need accounting (NetSuite/Dynamics for $5M revenue company)
- Not considering accountant's platform preference (friction with bookkeeper)
- Ignoring total cost of ownership (implementation + training + add-ons)
