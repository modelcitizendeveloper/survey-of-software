## Common Scenario Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing Platform Without Inventory When You Need It
**Scenario:** E-commerce business chooses FreshBooks
**Problem:** FreshBooks has no inventory tracking
**Fix:** Use QuickBooks Plus or Xero + Dear Inventory

---

### Mistake 2: Using General Accounting for Industry-Specific Needs
**Scenario:** Architecture firm uses QuickBooks Online
**Problem:** No AIA billing, retainage, or job costing depth
**Fix:** Use Sage Intacct with construction/AEC module or industry-specific software (Deltek)

---

### Mistake 3: Waiting Too Long to Upgrade
**Scenario:** $8M consulting firm still using QuickBooks with manual consolidation
**Problem:** Inefficiency, data integrity issues, poor reporting
**Fix:** Should have migrated to Sage Intacct at $5M revenue

---

### Mistake 4: Jumping to ERP Too Early
**Scenario:** $2M e-commerce business chooses NetSuite
**Problem:** $80K/year when $3K QuickBooks would suffice
**Fix:** Use QuickBooks until $10M revenue, then consider NetSuite

---

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Accountant Ecosystem
**Scenario:** Choosing Zoho Books when accountant only knows QuickBooks
**Problem:** Higher accounting fees, resistance from accountant
**Fix:** Involve accountant in platform selection or find Zoho-savvy accountant

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Business Model Drives Platform Choice
- **Service businesses:** Time tracking matters → FreshBooks or Sage Intacct
- **Product businesses:** Inventory matters → QuickBooks or NetSuite
- **Manufacturing:** Full ERP required → NetSuite or Dynamics 365

### 2. Revenue Triggers Are Real
- **<$100K:** Wave or basic platform
- **$100K-$1M:** Small business accounting (QB, Xero, FreshBooks)
- **$1M-$5M:** Advanced small business (QB Advanced, Xero Established)
- **$5M-$100M:** Mid-market (Sage Intacct or full ERP)

### 3. Users Matter
- **1-5 users:** Any platform works
- **6-25 users:** QuickBooks Advanced or Xero (unlimited)
- **26+ users:** Sage Intacct, NetSuite, or Dynamics 365

### 4. Feature Needs Trump Price
- Don't choose Wave if you need inventory (savings = $200/year but causes $5,000 in inefficiency)
- Don't choose FreshBooks for manufacturing (no BOM, job costing)
- Don't choose QuickBooks for 50-person consulting firm (need Sage Intacct)

### 5. Accountant Compatibility is Underrated
- QuickBooks: 80%+ of US accountants familiar
- Xero: Growing adoption, especially international
- Sage Intacct: Mid-market accountants know it
- Zoho Books: Fewer accountants, may pay more in accounting fees
