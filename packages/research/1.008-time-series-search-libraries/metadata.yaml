notes: |
  S1 Rapid Discovery completed. Core distinction from 1.073 (forecasting):
  - 1.073 = "What happens next?" (prediction, planning)
  - 1.008 = "What happened before?" (pattern search, similarity, anomaly detection)

  Key findings:
  - STUMPY dominates for unsupervised pattern/anomaly discovery (matrix profiles)
  - dtaidistance is fastest for pure DTW distance calculations (30-300x speedup)
  - sktime/tslearn compete for classification (sktime has more algorithms, tslearn focused on DTW/shapelets)
  - tsfresh generates statistical features (794+) for any classifier
  - pyts uniquely provides imaging methods (GAF, MTF, RP)

  Next steps (S2-S4): Detailed benchmarks, use case scenarios, strategic analysis.
