# S3: Need-Driven Discovery - Approach

## Purpose

S3 translates the technical library landscape (S1) into **business-driven scenarios** where time series search delivers measurable value. Rather than evaluating libraries in isolation, S3 matches libraries to real-world use cases with concrete business impact.

## Methodology

### 1. Scenario Selection Criteria

Selected scenarios based on:
- **Market demand**: Industries actively deploying time series search
- **ROI clarity**: Measurable business outcomes (cost reduction, revenue increase, risk mitigation)
- **Technical fit**: Use cases where search (not forecasting) is the primary need
- **Library differentiation**: Scenarios that demonstrate when to choose one library over another

### 2. Analysis Framework

For each scenario, we evaluate:

**Business Context**:
- Industry vertical and specific pain point
- Current manual/alternative approach and its limitations
- Expected ROI and timeline to value

**Technical Requirements**:
- Data characteristics (volume, velocity, variety)
- Search pattern (similarity, motif discovery, anomaly detection, classification)
- Performance constraints (latency, throughput, accuracy)
- Integration complexity (existing tech stack, team skills)

**Library Recommendation**:
- Primary library choice with detailed rationale
- Configuration/architecture guidance
- Alternative libraries for comparison
- Implementation gotchas and migration paths

### 3. Scenarios Covered

We selected 5 scenarios across different industries and search patterns:

1. **Manufacturing Quality Control** - Anomaly detection in sensor data
2. **Healthcare Patient Monitoring** - Pattern classification for diagnosis
3. **Financial Fraud Detection** - Motif discovery in transaction patterns
4. **E-commerce Recommendation** - Customer behavior clustering
5. **Infrastructure Monitoring** - Real-time anomaly detection at scale

Each scenario provides:
- Problem statement with business metrics
- Data profile and technical constraints
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Expected outcomes and success metrics
- Cost/benefit analysis

## Decision Framework

The scenarios collectively answer:
- **When** to use time series search vs. other approaches
- **Which** library to choose for specific business needs
- **How** to architect solutions for production deployment
- **What** ROI to expect and how to measure it

## Validation

Scenarios are validated against:
- Real-world deployments (case studies, conference talks)
- Library documentation examples
- Performance benchmarks from S1
- Production deployment patterns from industry practitioners

## Next Steps to S4

S3 provides the **tactical playbook** (how to implement). S4 will provide the **strategic context** (when to invest, long-term viability, vendor ecosystem, competitive landscape).
