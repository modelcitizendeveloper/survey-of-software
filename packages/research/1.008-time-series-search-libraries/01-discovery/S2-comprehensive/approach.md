# S2: Comprehensive Analysis - Approach

## Purpose

S2 provides deeper technical analysis beyond S1's rapid discovery, focusing on:
- Detailed feature comparisons across all 6 libraries
- Performance benchmarking on standardized datasets
- Integration complexity and deployment considerations

## Methodology

**Benchmarking**: UCR Time Series Archive datasets for classification accuracy
**Performance testing**: Speed comparisons on consistent hardware (CPU/GPU)
**Integration analysis**: Dependencies, API complexity, production deployment patterns

## Key Questions

1. Which DTW variant performs best for which dataset characteristics?
2. How do ROCKET vs. shapelets compare on accuracy/speed trade-offs?
3. What are the real-world integration challenges (dependencies, versioning)?

## Deliverables

- Feature-by-feature comparison matrices
- Performance benchmark results
- Integration complexity analysis
- Deployment recommendations by scale
