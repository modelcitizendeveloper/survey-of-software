# S2-Comprehensive: Approach

## Evaluation Method

Comprehensive analysis of Classical Chinese parsing tools, expanding beyond S1 to include:

1. **Academic Tools** - University research projects and papers
2. **Chinese Domestic Libraries** - Tools from Chinese institutions
3. **Specialized Classical Chinese Tools** - 文言文-specific parsers
4. **Hybrid Approaches** - Combinations of rule-based and ML methods

## Extended Library Search

In addition to S1 libraries:
1. **Jiayan (嘉言)** - Specialized Classical Chinese NLP library
2. **THUOCL** - Tsinghua Open Chinese Lexicon with classical support
3. **Academic parsers** - Research implementations from papers
4. **Rule-based systems** - Grammar-driven parsers

## Deep Dive Criteria

For each tool:
- **Technical architecture**: Rule-based vs ML, training data used
- **Feature completeness**: Tokenization, POS, parsing, NER coverage
- **Performance metrics**: Accuracy on Classical Chinese benchmarks (if available)
- **Integration complexity**: Installation, dependencies, API quality
- **Training data**: What corpus was used? Modern vs Classical?
- **Maintainability**: Last update, issue responsiveness, community activity

## Feature Comparison Matrix

Will create comprehensive comparison across:
- Tokenization/segmentation accuracy for Classical Chinese
- Part-of-speech tagging support
- Dependency/constituency parsing
- Named entity recognition (historical names, places, titles)
- License and cost
- Language support (Python, Java, etc.)

## Time Box

2-3 hours for comprehensive search and documentation
