# S4-Strategic: Approach

## Evaluation Method

Strategic assessment of Classical Chinese parsing landscape through maturity analysis. Focus on:

1. **Ecosystem maturity**: How developed is the field overall?
2. **Technology readiness**: What's production-ready vs research prototype?
3. **Community & governance**: Who maintains these tools? Sustainability?
4. **Strategic positioning**: Where are the opportunities and risks?
5. **Long-term outlook**: What's the 5-10 year trajectory?

## Analysis Framework

### Technology Maturity (TRL - Technology Readiness Levels)
- **TRL 1-3**: Basic research
- **TRL 4-6**: Proof of concept, prototype
- **TRL 7-8**: Production-ready, deployed
- **TRL 9**: Mature, widely adopted

### Organizational Maturity
- **Stage 1**: Individual researchers
- **Stage 2**: Research labs/projects
- **Stage 3**: Institutionalized (organizations maintaining)
- **Stage 4**: Ecosystem (multiple organizations, standards)

### Market Maturity
- **Nascent**: Few users, no clear use cases
- **Emerging**: Early adopters, use cases forming
- **Growth**: Multiple products, growing user base
- **Mature**: Established market, clear leaders

## Libraries Analyzed

1. **Stanford CoreNLP** - Maturity analysis
2. **ctext.org** - Platform sustainability
3. **Jiayan** - Open-source project health

## Strategic Questions

1. Is this a viable long-term investment domain?
2. What are the key risks and opportunities?
3. Who are the stakeholders and what are their incentives?
4. What would it take to move the field forward significantly?
5. Should we build, buy, or wait?

## Time Box

3-4 hours for strategic analysis and synthesis
