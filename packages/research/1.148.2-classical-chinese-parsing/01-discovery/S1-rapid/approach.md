# S1-Rapid: Approach

## Evaluation Method

Quick assessment of available libraries for Classical Chinese parsing based on:

1. **Active Maintenance** - Is the project still maintained? Recent releases?
2. **Core Capabilities** - Does it address Classical Chinese parsing, segmentation, and analysis?
3. **Ease of Access** - Available via PyPI, Maven, or direct download? Clear documentation?
4. **First Impressions** - Documentation quality, community size, obvious strengths/weaknesses

## Libraries Evaluated

1. **Stanford CoreNLP** - Java-based NLP toolkit with Chinese support
2. **ctext.org API** - Chinese Text Project API for Classical Chinese corpus access

## Time Box

45-60 minutes per library for initial investigation. Focus on:
- What it claims to do
- How mature it appears
- Whether it handles Classical Chinese (文言文) specifically
- Tokenization and parsing capabilities

## Decision Criteria

- Can it segment/tokenize Classical Chinese text?
- Does it provide dependency parsing for Classical Chinese?
- Can it handle pre-modern Chinese grammar structures?
- Is it production-ready?
- Python/Java support quality
