completion_notes: |
  Completed February 6, 2026. Comprehensive analysis of Classical Chinese parsing
  tools and strategies across existing solutions (Stanford CoreNLP, Jiayan, ctext.org)
  and custom development approaches.

  Key strategic insight: No production-ready solution exists, but foundation is available
  (Jiayan for segmentation + ctext.org for corpus access). Organizations must build
  custom POS tagging, parsing, and NER components. This creates both challenge and
  opportunity - 2-3 year strategic window before competition increases.

  Critical finding: Accuracy requirements vary widely by use case (70% for reading
  assistants, 90%+ for literature search). Most use cases tolerate errors with good
  UX for correction, so perfect accuracy is not necessary. This contradicts common
  assumption that NLP systems must achieve 95%+ accuracy.

  Market reality: Small but global (50K-200K potential users), sustainable with niche
  focus but not venture-scale. Three viable paths: commercial product ($50K-200K/year
  revenue), grant-funded infrastructure ($500K-$1M over 3-4 years), or open-source +
  services ($100K-500K/year). Each path has different timelines, risks, and outcomes.

  Technical insight: Hybrid rule-based + ML approach recommended for Classical Chinese.
  Classical grammar is well-documented, making rule-based parsing viable for common
  patterns. ML handles ambiguity resolution. This differs from modern NLP's pure
  neural approach, but suits Classical Chinese's smaller training data availability.

  Practical impact: Research provides concrete development roadmaps for three primary
  use cases (reading assistant, document digitization, literature search) with specific
  timelines (2-4 weeks to 24 months), budgets ($5K to $365K), and success criteria.
  Phased implementation plan enables iterative development with clear milestones.

  Risk assessment: Main risks are annotated training data quality (requires expert
  Classical Chinese linguists), performance ceiling (may not reach modern Chinese
  accuracy levels), and dependency on small number of maintainers (Jiayan, ctext.org).
  Mitigation strategies include fork/abstraction layers, realistic accuracy targets,
  and contingency planning for tool dependencies.

  Long-term trends: Digital humanities growing, grant funding available (NEH, Mellon),
  but commercial market remains niche. Open-source approach with institutional backing
  most sustainable long-term. Integration with existing tools (Pleco, ctext.org) more
  valuable than competing head-to-head.

  Implementation reality: Reading assistant achievable in 2-4 weeks with existing tools,
  production NLP pipeline requires 12 months and $235K-365K investment. Most organizations
  underestimate annotation effort (500-2000 hours) and Classical Chinese linguistic
  expertise requirements.
