### Question 1: How many customers/leads do you manage?

## Specific Use Case Recommendations

### Wine Bar with B2B Wholesale (10-50 Accounts)

**Situation**: Wine bar with retail customers (B2C, handled by POS loyalty) + wholesale pipeline (B2B)

**Recommended**: Zoho Bigin ($7-12/user/month)
- ✅ Affordable for small B2B account count
- ✅ Simple pipeline for wholesale deals
- ✅ Workflow automation for follow-ups
- ✅ Can upgrade to Zoho CRM if wholesale grows

**Runner-up**: Pipedrive Essential ($14/user)
- Better visual pipeline
- $7/month premium might be worth it for UX

**Avoid**: Close ($75/month minimum), HubSpot (overkill), Salesforce (way overkill)

---

### Solo Founder SaaS (0-100 Customers)

**Recommended**: HubSpot Free
- ✅ $0 cost while bootstrapping
- ✅ Unlimited users
- ✅ Marketing tools (landing pages, forms)
- ✅ Can upgrade when revenue justifies

**Runner-up**: Zoho Bigin ($7/user)
- If you want to avoid HubSpot lock-in
- Clean, simple interface

**Avoid**: Salesforce (too early), Close (not calling-heavy yet)

---

### 10-Person Sales Team (500 Customers, B2B SaaS)

**Recommended**: Pipedrive Advanced ($29/user = $290/month)
- ✅ Visual pipeline for team coordination
- ✅ Workflow automation
- ✅ Team management features
- ✅ Sales analytics

**Runner-up**: HubSpot Professional ($1,600/month)
- If marketing automation is also needed
- Higher cost but more features

**Avoid**: Zoho Bigin (too limited for 10 people), Salesforce (not complex enough yet)

---

### Enterprise Sales (100+ Reps, Complex Deal Cycles)

**Recommended**: Salesforce Enterprise ($165-330/user)
- ✅ Industry standard
- ✅ Infinite customization
- ✅ Territory management
- ✅ Advanced forecasting

**Runner-up**: HubSpot Enterprise ($3,600/month)
- If marketing-led sales
- Easier to use than Salesforce

**Avoid**: Lightweight CRMs (won't scale), budget options (penny-wise, pound-foolish)

---

### Agency (20-100 Clients, Project-Based)

**Recommended**: Copper ($29-59/user)
- ✅ Gmail-native (most agencies live in Gmail)
- ✅ Client relationship tracking
- ✅ Project pipeline
- ✅ Google Workspace integration

**Runner-up**: Pipedrive ($29/user) OR HubSpot Professional
- Pipedrive: Better sales pipeline
- HubSpot: Better for inbound agency marketing

**Avoid**: Close (not calling-heavy), Salesforce (overkill)

---

## The "Don't Choose CRM Yet" Recommendation

**If you have <50 customers AND simple sales:**

**Use instead:**
- **Google Sheets** + **Google Calendar** + **Gmail**
- **Airtable** (spreadsheet + kanban for $10/month)
- **Notion** (CRM templates for $10/month)

**Revisit CRM when:**
- >50 customers
- Forgetting follow-ups
- Sales team >1 person
- Sales cycle >30 days
- Lost a deal due to poor tracking

**Why wait?**
- Avoid learning curve when you should be selling
- Avoid paying for features you don't use
- Easier to pick right CRM when you understand your process

## Red Flags & Common Mistakes

### ❌ "We'll grow into Salesforce"
**Problem**: You'll waste 2-5 years and $100K+ trying
**Instead**: Start simple, upgrade when complexity demands it

### ❌ "Free tier forever"
**Problem**: HubSpot free tier locks you in, then forces upgrade
**Instead**: Use free tier knowing you'll pay eventually, or choose Bigin

### ❌ "Most features for lowest price"
**Problem**: Feature bloat ≠ value. You'll use 20% of features.
**Instead**: Pay for what you'll actually use

### ❌ "We're a sales team, choose Close"
**Problem**: Only worth it if you make >30 calls/day per rep
**Instead**: Pipedrive or Bigin unless calling is 70%+ of sales motion

### ❌ "Choose the CRM the founder used at their last company"
**Problem**: Different company, different needs, selection bias
**Instead**: Evaluate based on YOUR customer count, sales motion, budget

## Final Decision Framework

**Ask these questions in order:**

1. **Do we need a CRM at all?** (See 4.090 Architecture Decision)
   - <50 customers → probably not yet

2. **What's our customer count?**
   - 50-200 → Lightweight (Bigin, Pipedrive)
   - 200-2,000 → Mid-market (HubSpot, Zoho CRM, Pipedrive)
   - 2,000+ → Enterprise (Salesforce, HubSpot Enterprise)

3. **What's our sales motion?**
   - Inbound/marketing-led → HubSpot
   - Outbound/calling-heavy → Close (if >30 calls/day) OR Pipedrive
   - Relationship/account management → Pipedrive, Copper, Zoho Bigin

4. **What's our budget?**
   - $0 → HubSpot Free
   - $10-30/user → Zoho Bigin OR Pipedrive
   - $30-100/user → Pipedrive Professional OR Close
   - $100+/user → HubSpot Professional OR Salesforce

5. **Do we have technical resources?**
   - No → Avoid Salesforce, choose Bigin/Pipedrive/HubSpot
   - Yes → Salesforce becomes option (if other factors align)

---

## The Spawn-Methodology Take

**Most businesses should choose:**
1. **Zoho Bigin** (if budget-conscious) OR
2. **Pipedrive** (if value UX and willing to pay $14-29/user)

**Choose HubSpot if:**
- Marketing automation is core to business model
- Willing to accept lock-in for all-in-one convenience

**Choose Close if:**
- Calling is >70% of sales activity
- Team makes >30 calls/day per rep

**Choose Salesforce if:**
- Enterprise-scale (100+ sales reps)
- Complex, custom sales processes
- Dedicated Salesforce admin/resources

**For small B2B operations** (10-50 accounts): Zoho Bigin is the answer. $7-12/month, simple pipeline, room to grow.
