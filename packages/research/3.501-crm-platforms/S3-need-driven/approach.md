---

## Methodology

Create **generic business patterns** (not specific clients) that represent common CRM use cases.

### Scenario Structure

Each scenario follows template:
```
# Scenario: [Generic Archetype]

**Business Pattern**: [Type + characteristics]
**Decision Context**: [Customer count, team size, budget, sales motion]
**Recommended Platform**: [Primary choice + reasoning]
**Alternative Options**: [2-3 alternatives with trade-offs]
**Migration Path**: [Growth trajectory recommendations]

**Applies to**: [List of similar business types]
```

## Scenarios to Create

1. **Wine Bar / Hybrid B2C + B2B** (10-50 B2B accounts)
2. **SaaS Startup** (0-500 customers, solo to 10-person team)
3. **Agency / Professional Services** (20-100 clients)
4. **E-commerce / Retail** (1,000+ customers, loyalty focus)

## Key Principle

✅ "A wine bar with..." (generic pattern)
❌ "WeRise wine bar" (specific client)

**Test**: Can this scenario be used for the NEXT similar business?
