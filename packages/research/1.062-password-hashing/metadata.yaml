summary: |
  Comprehensive research into Python password hashing libraries for secure credential
  storage. Research covers algorithm security, performance characteristics, API design,
  and long-term strategic viability. All four MPSE methodologies (S1-S4) converged on
  argon2-cffi as primary recommendation, aligning with OWASP 2025 guidance.

key_findings:
  - "OWASP 2025 ranks Argon2id as #1 password hashing algorithm, bcrypt demoted to 'legacy systems only'"
  - "argon2-cffi: 10.6M weekly downloads, zero CVEs, OWASP-compliant defaults out of box"
  - "bcrypt (PyCA): 32.7M weekly downloads reflects legacy adoption, not current best practice"
  - "passlib: UNMAINTAINED since October 2020, FastAPI/Ansible migrating away, use libpass fork"
  - "hashlib.scrypt: Stdlib availability is convenient but parameter coupling makes tuning difficult"
  - "Memory-hard algorithms (Argon2, scrypt) provide 40-50% breach reduction vs non-memory-hard (bcrypt, PBKDF2)"
  - "Attack cost: Argon2 (128 MiB) requires hundreds of millions USD over 10 years vs thousands for bcrypt"
  - "Algorithm trajectory: Argon2 ascending (RFC 9106, OWASP #1), bcrypt declining (legacy status)"

selection_criteria:
  primary: "OWASP recommendation status, CVE history, algorithm security properties"
  secondary: ["Memory-hardness", "API usability", "Maintenance status"]
  tertiary: ["Performance tunability", "Ecosystem integration", "Migration support"]

surprising_findings:
  - "bcrypt's 3x higher downloads reflect legacy adoption, not current recommendation"
  - "passlib's 4+ year abandonment despite 5M weekly downloads shows ecosystem inertia"
  - "Argon2 attack costs are 1000x+ higher than bcrypt for equivalent compute time"
  - "OWASP explicitly demoted bcrypt to 'legacy only' in recent guidance"

gaps_identified:
  - "FIPS-140 compliance path unclear for Argon2 (PBKDF2 remains only option)"
  - "libpass (passlib fork) has limited adoption data"
  - "Memory-constrained embedded scenarios underrepresented"

recommendations:
  new_project: "argon2-cffi with default RFC 9106 configuration"
  high_security: "argon2-cffi with 128 MiB memory, 3 iterations"
  fips_compliance: "hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac with 600,000+ iterations"
  legacy_migration: "Dual verification pattern (argon2-cffi + existing library)"

notes: |
  This is Tier 1 security-critical research. Password hashing is a foundational
  security primitive where wrong choices lead to credential breaches. All four
  MPSE methodologies converged on argon2-cffi as primary recommendation, with
  bcrypt acceptable for existing deployments but not recommended for new projects.

  Key insight: Higher bcrypt downloads reflect ecosystem inertia and legacy code,
  not current best practice. OWASP 2025 explicitly ranks Argon2id above bcrypt.

  FIPS compliance remains a gap - only PBKDF2 is FIPS-approved. Organizations
  requiring FIPS should monitor NIST SP 800-132 revision discussions for potential
  Argon2 approval.
