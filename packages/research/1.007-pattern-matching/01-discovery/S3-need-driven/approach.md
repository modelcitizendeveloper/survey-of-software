# S3 Approach: Need-Driven Discovery

## What S3 Discovers

S3 answers: **WHO needs pattern matching + WHY?**

Focus: Use cases, personas, requirements → algorithm matching.

## Methodology

### Start with Needs, Not Algorithms

1. **Identify persona**: Who is building what?
2. **Extract requirements**: What constraints matter?
3. **Map to algorithms**: Which techniques fit the scenario?
4. **Validate**: Does this solve the actual problem?

### Use Case Format

Each use case answers:
- **Who**: User persona and context
- **Why**: Business/technical requirements
- **Constraints**: Performance, memory, simplicity, correctness
- **Solution**: Recommended algorithm + library
- **Alternatives**: Other options if requirements change
- **Pitfalls**: Common mistakes to avoid

## Use Cases Covered

1. **Text Editor Search**: Interactive find/replace (VS Code, Sublime)
2. **Network Security (IDS)**: Real-time intrusion detection (Snort, Suricata)
3. **Bioinformatics**: DNA sequence analysis (BLAST, alignment)
4. **Log Analysis**: Pattern extraction from system logs (ELK, Splunk)
