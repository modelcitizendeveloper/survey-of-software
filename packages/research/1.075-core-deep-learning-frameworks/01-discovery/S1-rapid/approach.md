# S1: Rapid Discovery - Approach

## Methodology: Speed-Focused, Ecosystem-Driven

**Time budget:** 10 minutes per framework (40 minutes total)
**Goal:** Identify viable frameworks, eliminate obvious non-starters, surface key differentiators

## Data Sources (Prioritized for Speed)

1. **GitHub metrics** (5 min/framework)
   - Stars, forks, commit velocity (ecosystem health)
   - Issue close rate (maintenance quality)
   - Recent activity (abandonment risk)

2. **Papers With Code** (3 min/framework)
   - Research paper usage trends (2020-2024)
   - Benchmark implementations (framework preference in practice)

3. **Job market signals** (2 min/framework)
   - LinkedIn/Indeed job postings (industry demand)
   - StackOverflow activity (developer adoption)

## Evaluation Criteria

Each framework scored 0-10 on:
- **Ecosystem health** (GitHub activity, community size)
- **Production maturity** (serving tools, deployment options)
- **Research adoption** (paper citations, benchmark implementations)
- **Learning curve** (documentation, tutorials, error messages)
- **Performance** (training speed, inference latency - from published benchmarks)

**Speed Score = (Ecosystem + Maturity + Adoption + Learning + Performance) / 5**

## Exclusion Criteria

Frameworks excluded if:
- <500 GitHub stars (insufficient community)
- No commits in 6+ months (abandonment risk)
- <1% research paper usage (declining relevance)

## Limitations of Rapid Discovery

**What this pass does NOT provide:**
- Detailed performance benchmarks (see S2-comprehensive)
- Use-case specific recommendations (see S3-need-driven)
- Long-term viability assessment (see S4-strategic)

**What this pass DOES provide:**
- Quick elimination of non-viable options
- Identification of clear leaders vs niche players
- Surface-level understanding of trade-offs

## Expected Outcome

**High-confidence outputs:**
- 2-3 frameworks clearly dominate
- 1-2 frameworks are niche/declining

**Uncertainty that requires deeper passes:**
- Performance differences (need benchmarks)
- Use-case fit (need real-world scenarios)
- Long-term risk (need maintenance/governance analysis)

**Time commitment:** 40 minutes total
**Confidence target:** 70-80% (sufficient to eliminate bad choices, insufficient for final decision)
