## Maintenance Health

- **Last Commit:** < 24 hours ago (daily activity)
- **Commit Frequency:** 10-20 per week
- **Open Issues:** ~200 (manageable)
- **Issue Resolution:** < 48 hours average
- **Maintainers:** 3-5 core team + 100+ contributors
- **Bus Factor:** Medium-Low risk (small core team but growing)

**Grade:** A (very active)

---

## Community Trajectory

- **Stars Trend:** Growing rapidly (40k → 57k in 6 months)
- **Contributors:** 800+ (growing)
- **Ecosystem Adoption:**
  - LangChain official support
  - Major framework integrations
  - Community Docker images
  - Production deployment stories emerging

- **Corporate Backing:** Unclear (appears independent)

**Grade:** A (strong growth)

---

## Stability Assessment

- **Semver Compliance:** Pre-1.0 (0.x versions)
- **Breaking Changes:** Occasional (expected for pre-1.0)
- **Deprecation Policy:** Communicated via changelog
- **Migration Path:** Good upgrade guides

## 5-Year Outlook

**Will Ollama be viable in 2031?**

**Positive Signals:**
- Rapid adoption (57k stars in 1.5 years)
- Strong momentum (fastest-growing in category)
- Clear value proposition (ease of use)
- Ecosystem integration expanding

**Risk Factors:**
- Young project (< 2 years old)
- Pre-1.0 (API stability unclear)
- Dependency on llama.cpp (upstream risk)
- Unknown corporate backing (sustainability risk)

**Verdict:** Likely viable (80% confidence)

**Scenario:**
- 2026-2028: Reaches 1.0, API stabilizes
- 2028-2031: Becomes standard for easy LLM serving (like Docker for containers)
- Risk: If llama.cpp pivots or another easier solution emerges

---

## Strategic Risk: **MEDIUM**

**Why Medium:**
- ✅ Strong growth and adoption
- ✅ Active development
- ⚠️ Young project (track record < 2 years)
- ⚠️ Unclear long-term sustainability model

**Recommendation:** Safe for 2-3 year horizon, monitor for 5+ years
