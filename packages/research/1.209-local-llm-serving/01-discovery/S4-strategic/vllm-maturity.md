## 5-Year Outlook

**Will vLLM be viable in 2031?**

**Positive Signals:**
- Academic research foundation (PagedAttention paper)
- Production adoption at scale (Anthropic, others)
- Cloud platform support (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Institutional backing (UC Berkeley)
- Active research development (new features from papers)

**Risk Factors:**
- Newer competitor with better algorithms could emerge
- Hardware evolution (new architectures)

**Verdict:** Highly likely viable (95% confidence)

**Scenario:**
- 2026-2031: Becomes standard for production LLM serving
- Continues research-driven innovation
- Likely: Additional hardware optimizations (next-gen GPUs)
- Risk: Low (strong foundation, institutional backing)
