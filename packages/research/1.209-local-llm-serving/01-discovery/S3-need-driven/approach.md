# S3: Need-Driven Discovery - Approach

**Philosophy:** "Start with requirements, find exact-fit solutions"
**Time Budget:** 20 minutes
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Methodology

### Discovery Strategy

Requirement-focused discovery that maps real-world use cases to optimal solutions, validating fit against must-have and nice-to-have criteria.

### Use Case Selection

Identified 5 representative scenarios spanning the full deployment spectrum:

1. **Local Development & Prototyping**
2. **Production API (High Traffic)**
3. **Edge/IoT Deployment**
4. **Internal Tools (Low-Medium Traffic)**
5. **Personal Desktop Use (Non-Developer)**

---

## Evaluation Framework

### Requirement Categories

**Must-Have** (blockers if missing):
- Performance minimums
- Platform constraints
- Licensing requirements
- Technical capabilities

**Nice-to-Have** (differentiators):
- Advanced features
- Ecosystem integrations
- Developer experience
- Operational ease

### Fit Scoring

- ✅ **100%** - Meets all must-haves + most nice-to-haves
- ⚠️ **70-99%** - Meets must-haves, some gaps in nice-to-haves
- ❌ **<70%** - Missing critical must-haves

---

## Selection Criteria

**Per Use Case:**
1. List all requirements (must + nice)
2. Map each solution against requirements
3. Calculate fit percentage
4. Identify best-fit solution
5. Note trade-offs

**Independence:** No knowledge of S1/S2 recommendations
**Outcome:** May recommend different solutions per use case
