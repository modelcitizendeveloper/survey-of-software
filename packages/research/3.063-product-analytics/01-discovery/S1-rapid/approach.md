# S1 Rapid Discovery: Product Analytics

## Methodology

This rapid discovery phase uses a **popularity-based assessment** to identify the most viable product analytics platforms for quick implementation. The approach prioritizes providers with strong market presence, transparent pricing, and fast setup times to enable rapid experimentation.

### Selection Criteria

**Primary Criteria:**
1. **Market Presence**: GitHub stars (for open-source), G2 ratings, industry mentions
2. **Pricing Transparency**: Publicly available pricing information or clear free tiers
3. **Setup Time Estimate**: Time to first analytics event (< 1 hour preferred)
4. **Feature Completeness**: Core analytics (funnels, retention, segmentation)

**Secondary Criteria:**
1. **Self-Service Capability**: Can start without sales call
2. **Developer Experience**: SDK quality, documentation
3. **Data Ownership**: Self-hosting options, data export capabilities

### Provider Selection Process

**Phase 1: Market Research (15 minutes)**
- Searched top product analytics tools for 2025
- Identified 10 providers from project brief
- Validated current market positioning and acquisition status

**Phase 2: Deep Dive on Top Providers (20 minutes)**
- Researched pricing, features, and setup for each provider
- Collected GitHub stars for open-source options
- Documented key differentiators

**Phase 3: Filtering (5 minutes)**
- Excluded providers with unclear pricing or defunct status
- Prioritized providers with strong self-service options
- Selected top 8 providers for detailed documentation

### Providers Evaluated

1. **PostHog** - Open-source, self-hostable, 29.5k+ GitHub stars
2. **Mixpanel** - Industry standard, transparent pricing, strong funnel analysis
3. **Amplitude** - Enterprise leader, robust free tier, CDP integration
4. **Heap** - Auto-capture pioneer, retroactive analysis
5. **Pendo** - Full Software Experience Management platform
6. **FullStory** - Session replay specialist, behavior analytics
7. **LogRocket** - Developer-focused, error tracking integration
8. **Kubit** - Warehouse-native, no-event pricing model

**Excluded Providers:**
- **June**: Acquired by Amplitude (no longer independent)
- **Indicative**: Now mParticle Analytics (outdated pricing info)

### Time Constraints

**Total Time Budget**: 30-45 minutes
**Actual Time Spent**: ~40 minutes
- Research: 25 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes

### Limitations

This rapid discovery has the following limitations:
1. **No Hands-On Testing**: Assessments based on documentation, not actual usage
2. **Pricing Estimates**: Some vendors require sales contact for exact pricing
3. **Feature Depth**: Surface-level feature comparison only
4. **Integration Assessment**: Limited evaluation of third-party integrations

### Next Steps

For S2 Comprehensive Discovery:
- Hands-on testing with top 3 providers
- Detailed pricing analysis for target scale (10k-100k users)
- Integration testing with existing tech stack
- Performance benchmarking for query speed and data processing

### Success Metrics for S1

- Identified 8 viable providers with documented pricing
- Found 1 open-source option (PostHog) for self-hosting
- Documented setup time estimates for all providers
- Created reusable provider files for cross-experiment reference
