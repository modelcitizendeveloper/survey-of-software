notes: "Second research item using MPSE v2.0 monolithic format. Completes top-down discovery cycle (3.004 Tier 3 SaaS → 1.127 Tier 1 Libraries) for cash flow management. Data sources fully accessible (PyPI, GitHub - no blocks unlike 3.004 G2/Capterra restrictions)."

summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of 8 Python financial simulation libraries across 4 methodologies (S1-S4). Research evaluated pandas, numpy-financial, QuantLib, Prophet, vectorbt, PyMC, statsmodels, scipy.stats for business finance, quant finance, and research use cases. Key finding: No Swiss Army knife - must combine pandas (universal foundation, 99.9% 10-year survival) + domain-specific library (numpy-financial for cash flow, QuantLib for derivatives, Prophet for forecasting). SaaS vs DIY breakpoint: $800/month (below → buy 3.004 SaaS like Pulse/Finmark, above → DIY with libraries). Integrated 1.127 with 3.004 research: SaaS for collaboration/ease-of-use, libraries for customization/cost-savings at scale. Multi-methodology validation confirmed: S1 market structure, S2 technical comparison, S3 scenario mapping, S4 long-term viability - all four essential for complete picture.
