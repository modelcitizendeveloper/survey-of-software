# S2: Comprehensive Analysis Approach
**Time Budget**: 25-30 minutes
**Goal**: Deep feature comparison, operational requirements, deployment trade-offs

---

## Methodology

Deep-dive analysis across technical, operational, and cost dimensions:

### 1. Feature Comparison Matrix (10 min)
- Core CRM features (contacts, pipeline, activities)
- Advanced features (automation, reporting, customization)
- Integration capabilities
- Mobile support
- Platform-specific strengths/gaps

### 2. Deployment Guide (8 min)
- Infrastructure requirements by deployment model:
  - Pure self-hosted (Docker, VPS, K8s)
  - Managed open source (vendor options)
- Operational runbook (setup, maintenance, updates)
- Skill level requirements
- Ongoing time commitments

### 3. TCO Deep Dive (7 min)
- Infrastructure costs by scale (3, 10, 50, 100 users)
- Operational labor costs (setup, monthly maintenance)
- Managed open source pricing
- Breakeven analysis vs proprietary SaaS (3.501)
- Hidden costs and gotchas

### 4. Technical Evaluation (5 min)
- Tech stack maturity
- Customization depth and approaches
- API quality and documentation
- Community support and ecosystem
- Update/upgrade complexity
