## Methodology

Rapid assessment of self-hosted CRM platforms focusing on operational requirements and deployment feasibility:

### 1. Platform Profiles (10 min)
For each platform (Twenty CRM, Odoo, SuiteCRM, EspoCRM):
- Tech stack and maturity
- Deployment complexity (Docker, VPS, K8s)
- Resource requirements (RAM, CPU, storage)
- Skill level required
- Quick TCO estimate vs managed alternatives

### 2. Deployment Decision Tree (5 min)
- Match technical capability → platform choice
- Match team size → infrastructure sizing
- Match budget → deployment model
- Quick "should I self-host?" assessment

### 3. Key Trade-offs (5 min)
- Self-hosted vs Managed CRM comparison
- Operational burden vs cost savings
- Learning curve vs long-term control
