- **Multi-location bar groups** needing centralized control
- **Operations valuing accuracy over cost** (99.7% precision critical)

## Not Ideal For

- Food-only restaurants (no beverage program)
- Budget-constrained single locations (<$150/month budget)
- Very small cafes or quick-service restaurants
- Operations preferring software-only solutions
- Teams wanting DIY or open-source alternatives
- Restaurants with <$500K annual revenue

## Decision Factors

**Choose WISK if**:
- Bar or beverage-heavy operation (>50% revenue from drinks)
- Experiencing significant shrink (>5% variance currently)
- Need 99.7% accuracy for high-value spirits inventory
- Multi-location bar group requiring centralized tracking
- Budget allows $250-400/month for inventory platform
- Want hardware-integrated solution for speed and precision

**Skip WISK if**:
- Food-only or food-primary operation
- Budget <$200/month for inventory solution
- Prefer software-only (no hardware complexity)
- Small single location with simple inventory needs
- Want open-source or self-hosted alternative

## ROI Potential

**Shrink Reduction** (Primary Value Driver):
- Bars typically experience 5-15% shrink (overpouring, theft, spillage)
- WISK variance reporting reduces shrink by 2-5 percentage points
- $1M bar revenue × 25% beverage cost = $250K
- 15% shrink currently = $37,500/year loss
- Reduce to 10% shrink = $25,000 loss
- **Savings**: $12,500/year from 5-point shrink reduction
- Platform cost: ~$3,000/year ($250/month)
- **Net ROI**: $9,500/year or 317% return

**Inventory Speed Savings**:
- Traditional bar inventory: 3-5 hours/week
- WISK with scales: 30-60 minutes/week
- Savings: ~4 hours/week = 208 hours/year
- At $25/hour (manager labor) = $5,200/year
- **Time offset**: Covers 173% of platform cost

**Combined ROI**: $14,700/year or 490% return for high-shrink bar

**Caveat**: ROI highly dependent on current shrink levels. Food-only operations may see minimal ROI.

## Unique Positioning

**Hardware + Software Integration**: Only major platform bundling Bluetooth scales

**Accuracy-First**: 99.7% precision vs. 90-95% for software-only solutions

**Bar Specialization**: Purpose-built for beverage operations, not general-purpose inventory

**Premium Market**: Targets high-revenue, high-shrink operations willing to pay for accuracy
