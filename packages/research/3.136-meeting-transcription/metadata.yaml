notes: |
  This research focuses on solo professionals and small teams (1-10 people), not enterprise
  features. Evaluation criteria prioritize privacy policies (critical differentiator), pricing,
  accuracy, integration ecosystem, and ease of use.

  **Critical Finding - Privacy Spectrum**:
  - Fireflies: Zero data retention (best) - $10/mo
  - Fathom: Opt-out available (good) - $15/mo
  - Grain: Transparent, never sells (good) - $19/mo
  - Otter: Uses for training, legal issues (concerning) - $8.33/mo

  **Critical Finding - Free Tier Leader**:
  Fathom offers unlimited transcription + 5 AI summaries/month for $0, making it the
  best starting point for solo consultants with selective important meetings.

  Research provides a "hardware store" of options across privacy requirements, language
  needs, and budget constraints. Fathom free tier is optimal starting point, with clear
  upgrade paths based on volume, privacy, or feature needs.
