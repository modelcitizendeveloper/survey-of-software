# S3-need-driven: Solutions by Use Case

## Status: 🚧 PLANNED

This phase will map implementation strategies to real-world applications with cost models.

## Planned Topics

### 1. Language Learning Platforms
- Requirements analysis (graded readers, adaptive content)
- Implementation strategy (rule-based MVP → hybrid)
- Cost model (3-year TCO)
- Success metrics (learner engagement, comprehension)
- Case study examples

### 2. Accessibility Services
- Government document simplification
- Healthcare information
- Public service announcements
- Requirements (accuracy, consistency, auditability)
- Implementation strategy
- Compliance and legal considerations

### 3. Educational Publishers
- Textbook adaptation
- Multi-level content generation
- Editorial workflow integration
- Quality assurance requirements
- ROI analysis

### 4. AI Tutoring Systems
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Real-time simplification
- Personalization (beyond HSK levels)
- Latency requirements
- Implementation strategy

### 5. Decision Tree
- Use case → approach mapping
- Volume thresholds (rule-based vs neural)
- Accuracy requirements → implementation
- Budget constraints → solution

## Research Questions

1. **What accuracy is "good enough" for each use case?**
   - Learner apps: 70-80% (human reads output)
   - Publishing: 90%+ (editorial review)
   - Accessibility: 85%+ (legal compliance)

2. **What's the TCO over 3 years?**
   - Rule-based: $12K-$35K
   - Neural: $25K-$80K
   - Hybrid: $20K-$60K
   - Manual editing baseline: $24K-$72K/year

3. **When should you hire editors instead of automating?**
   - Volume < 100 texts/month
   - High-stakes content (legal, medical)
   - Niche domains (limited training data)

## Estimated Time

3-4 hours for use case mapping and cost modeling

## Deliverables (Planned)

- `use-case-language-learning.md`
- `use-case-accessibility.md`
- `use-case-publishers.md`
- `use-case-ai-tutoring.md`
- `decision-tree.md` - Which approach for which scenario
- `recommendation.md` - S3 summary
