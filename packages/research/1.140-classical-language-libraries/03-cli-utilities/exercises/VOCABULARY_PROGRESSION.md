# Vocabulary Progression for Latin Noun Exercises

## Pedagogical Strategy

**Critical Principle**: Introduce irregularities EARLY (Series 2) to prevent false universalization of patterns.

Students must learn that:
1. Model nouns show the PATTERN (Series 1)
2. Real vocabulary has VARIATIONS (Series 2+)
3. Irregularities are NORMAL, not exceptions

## Series 1: Model Nouns (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Learn pure declension patterns
**Words**: puella, ventus, miles, usus, res
**Characteristics**: Regular, predictable, textbook forms
**Status**: Implemented

## Series 2: Common Nouns (Essential Irregularities)

**Purpose**: Introduce most common irregular patterns early
**Level**: Beginner → Intermediate transition
**Vocabulary Count**: 10 words (2 per declension)

### 1st Declension (2 words)

1. **familia, -ae, f.** = family
   - **Regular** - follows puella pattern
   - High frequency, concrete meaning
   - Good for reinforcement

2. **via, -ae, f.** = road, way
   - **Regular** - follows puella pattern
   - Short stem, easy to spell
   - Common in phrases (via Appia)

### 2nd Declension (2 words)

3. **vir, virī, m.** = man, husband
   - **IRREGULAR**: Nominative singular has no ending
   - **IRREGULAR**: Vocative singular = vir (NOT *vire)
   - **Critical**: Most common 2nd decl masculine irregular
   - Shows that -us → -e vocative is NOT universal

4. **filius, filiī, m.** = son
   - **IRREGULAR**: Vocative singular = filī (NOT *filie)
   - **IRREGULAR**: Genitive singular can be filiī or filī (contracted)
   - Important -ius ending pattern (many names: Antonius, Julius)

### 3rd Declension (2 words)

5. **homo, hominis, m.** = human, person
   - **Regular i-stem variant** - mostly predictable
   - Genitive shows stem change (homin-)
   - Very common, essential vocabulary

6. **nomen, nominis, n.** = name
   - **Neuter 3rd declension** - NEW PATTERN
   - **CRITICAL**: Introduces neuter (nom = acc)
   - Shows that not all 3rd declension nouns are masculine
   - Common i-stem pattern

### 4th Declension (2 words)

7. **manus, manūs, f.** = hand
   - **IRREGULAR**: Feminine (most 4th decl are masculine)
   - Very common word
   - Shows gender ≠ declension

8. **domus, domūs, f.** = house, home
   - **HIGHLY IRREGULAR**: Mixes 2nd and 4th declension forms
   - Ablative: domō (2nd decl) OR domū (4th decl)
   - Locative case: domī (at home) - ONLY in this word commonly
   - **Critical**: Shows truly irregular nouns exist
   - Very high frequency word - can't avoid it

### 5th Declension (2 words)

9. **dies, diēī, m./f.** = day
   - **IRREGULAR**: Can be masculine OR feminine
   - Masculine when specific day, feminine when general
   - Most common 5th declension word
   - Essential for dates and time

10. **res, reī, f.** = thing, matter
    - **Regular** - already learned as model noun
    - Reinforcement in new context
    - res publica = republic (very common phrase)

## Why These Irregularities Matter

### Early Introduction Rationale

**vir** (word 3):
- Students must learn vocative ≠ -e for all 2nd declension
- Prevents overgeneralization from ventus → vente
- Very common word, can't postpone

**filius** (word 4):
- All -ius words work this way (names, titles)
- Vocative -ī appears constantly (O filī!)
- Better to learn early than be surprised

**nomen** (word 6):
- Neuter gender is DIFFERENT (nom = acc)
- Can't only learn masculine/feminine nouns
- Common enough to be unavoidable

**manus** (word 7):
- Gender ≠ declension (breaks common assumption)
- Shows 4th declension has feminines too

**domus** (word 8):
- TRUE irregularity (not just variant)
- Shows Latin has mixed-declension words
- So common it must be learned early

**dies** (word 9):
- Variable gender teaches flexibility
- Context determines grammar
- Essential for any real Latin reading

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Series 2 - Common Nouns)
**Rationale**: Introduces irregularities early to prevent false patterns
**Time**: Manual creation ~6 hours OR build auto-generator ~8 hours
**Impact**: HIGH - prevents misconceptions

### Short-term (Series 3-4 - Thematic)
**Rationale**: Builds vocabulary in related semantic fields
**Time**: 30 seconds each with auto-generator
**Impact**: MEDIUM - enables reading simple texts

### Medium-term (Series 5-6)
**Rationale**: Expands vocabulary for more complex texts
**Time**: 30 seconds each with auto-generator
**Impact**: MEDIUM - broader vocabulary base

## Irregular Noun Reference

### Common Irregular Patterns

**2nd Declension**:
- **-us → -e vocative**: amicus → amice (regular pattern)
- **-us → same vocative**: filius → filī, proper names ending -ius
- **No ending nominative**: vir, puer (vocative = nominative)

**3rd Declension**:
- **Neuter (nom = acc)**: nomen, corpus, tempus, mare
- **I-stem variants**: urbs, mons, mare (abl -ī, gen pl -ium)
- **Stem changes**: homo → homin-, rex → rēg-

**4th Declension**:
- **Feminine**: manus, domus (most are masculine)
- **Mixed declension**: domus (uses some 2nd decl forms)
- **Defective**: Only singular or only plural forms exist

**5th Declension**:
- **Variable gender**: dies (m/f depending on context)
- **Only -es stem**: All 5th decl end in -es

## Notes on Gender

**Gender is NOT predictable from declension!**

- 1st decl: Mostly feminine (familia), but some masculine (nauta = sailor)
- 2nd decl: Mostly masculine (ventus), many neuters (bellum), few feminine (manus)
- 3rd decl: All three genders mixed
- 4th decl: Mostly masculine (usus), some feminine (manus, domus)
- 5th decl: All feminine except dies (m/f)

**Students must learn gender with each word.**

## Auto-Generator Requirements

To support this vocabulary progression, the generator must handle:

1. ✅ Regular declension patterns
2. ✅ Ambiguous forms (gen/dat, dat/abl)
3. ⚠️ Irregular vocatives (vir, filius)
4. ⚠️ Neuter nouns (nom = acc)
5. ⚠️ I-stem variants (3rd decl)
6. ⚠️ Mixed-declension nouns (domus)
7. ⚠️ Variable gender (dies)
8. ⚠️ Stem changes (homo → homin-)

**Generator Priority**:
- Phase 1: Items 1-2 (handles Series 1 + regular Series 2 words)
- Phase 2: Items 3-4 (handles most of Series 2)
- Phase 3: Items 5-8 (handles all edge cases)
