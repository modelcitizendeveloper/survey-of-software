## Aedificator Sum

Pelliculam *Megalopolis* spectavi. Coppola, aedificator, centum viginti miliones dollariorum propriorum dedit. Quadraginta annos laboravit. Studios refutavit. Urbem utopicam aedificavit - suo modo.

Latina lingua in pellicula stellam agit. Lingua aedificatorum. Romani vias, aquaeductus, leges aedificaverunt. Verba in lapide inscripserunt.

Anno MMXXVI Londinium visitabo. Inscriptiones Latinae ubique sunt - in aedificiis, ecclesiis, monumentis. Olim ibi Latine loquebantur. Nunc in lapide scriptum manet. Legere volo quod aedificatores scripserunt.

Cogitavi: librum emere debeo? Non. Sum aedificator. Mea instrumenta aedificare possum.

**Die Lunae, hora sexta post meridiem**: Latinum refricare constitui.

**Die Martis, hora undecima**: *latin-train* perfeci. Viginti sex horae. Instrumentum interactivum declinationibus discendis. Nullus sumptus. Machina mea. Meus codex.

**Eodem die**: Eundem modum pecuniis analyticis applicavi. *fs-train* aedificavi. Una architectura, duo dominia.

**Modus universalis**:
- Data semel processa
- Clavis celeris respondet
- Statim iudicium
- LLM magister
- Nullus sumptus

**Intellexi**: Mea instrumenta aedificare possum. Meos codices. Meam educationem.

Sicut Coppola: pecunia propria, meo modo, sine compromisso.

Sicut Romani: aedificatores qui signum in lapide reliquerunt.

**Aedificator sum.**

## English Translation (for reference)

**I Am a Builder**

I watched the film *Megalopolis*. Coppola, a builder, gave 120 million dollars of his own money. He worked for forty years. He refused the studios. He built a utopian city - his way.

The Latin language plays a starring role in the film. Language of builders. Romans built roads, aqueducts, laws. They inscribed words in stone.

In 2026 I will visit London. Latin inscriptions are everywhere - on buildings, churches, monuments. They once spoke Latin there. Now it remains written in stone. I want to read what the builders wrote.

I thought: Should I buy a textbook? No. I am a builder. I can build my own tools.

**Monday, 6pm**: I decided to refresh my Latin.

**Tuesday, 11pm**: I completed *latin-train*. Twenty-six hours. Interactive tool for learning declensions. No cost. My machine. My textbook.

**Same day**: I applied the same pattern to financial analysis. I built *fs-train*. One architecture, two domains.

**Universal pattern**:
- Data processed once
- Keyboard responds quickly
- Immediate feedback
- LLM teacher
- No cost

**I understood**: I can build my own tools. My own textbooks. My own education.

Like Coppola: self-funded, my way, without compromise.

Like the Romans: builders who left their mark in stone.

**I am a builder.**

## Deployment Plan

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] latin-train deployed to website
- [ ] Interactive demo available
- [ ] Screenshot/video of app in action
- [ ] Link to try it (web version or download)

**Publishing strategy**:
- Post in Latin (demonstrates the tool works)
- Optional: Include English translation at end
- Link to latin-train: "Try it yourself"
- Screenshot of the app parsing this very blog post

**Meta angle**:
- Blog post written in Latin
- Blog post parsed by latin-train
- Blog post about building latin-train
- **Self-referential demonstration**

---

## Context

**Why Latin**:
- Saw Megalopolis (Latin as language of builders)
- London 2026 trip (read Latin inscriptions on buildings)
- GTD surfaced "Latin" (someday/maybe since 2003)

**Why this matters**:
- Self-funded builder (like Coppola)
- Build own tools (like Romans)
- Applied to finance same day (fs-train)
- Universal pattern for any domain

**The real story**:
Not about Latin. About **building your own education**.

## Alternative Angles

If straight Latin is too bold:

**Option A**: Bilingual (Latin + English side-by-side)
**Option B**: English post with Latin examples
**Option C**: Latin post with "Try parsing this with latin-train" CTA
**Option D**: Wait until you have video demo, then post Latin + video

**Recommended**: Option C (Latin post + interactive demo link)
- Most dramatic
- Demonstrates tool capability
- "I wrote this post in Latin using the tool I built"

## Word Count

Latin version: ~210 words
English translation: ~230 words

Perfect length for newsletter/blog post.
