# S2-Comprehensive Approach

## Objective
Deep technical dive into pypinyin and dragonmapper. Detailed feature analysis, API exploration, and comparative assessment of capabilities for Pinyin and Zhuyin conversion.

## Scope
Based on S1-rapid findings, focusing on the two libraries that support both Pinyin and Zhuyin:
- pypinyin (mozillazg/python-pinyin)
- dragonmapper (tsroten/dragonmapper)

**Excluded**: xpinyin (no Zhuyin support)

## Methodology
1. **Documentation deep dive**: Read official docs, API references, tutorials
2. **Feature enumeration**: List all conversion styles, options, and capabilities
3. **API patterns**: Understand usage patterns, common workflows, edge cases
4. **Dependency analysis**: What does each library require?
5. **Maintenance signals**: Commit history, issue activity, release cadence
6. **Community health**: Contributors, downloads, usage examples in the wild
7. **Comparison matrix**: Side-by-side feature comparison

## Research Questions
1. What are ALL the style options in pypinyin?
2. How comprehensive is dragonmapper's transcription coverage?
3. What are the accuracy trade-offs between the two?
4. How do they handle edge cases (rare characters, polyphones, punctuation)?
5. What are the performance characteristics?
6. Can they work with both Traditional and Simplified Chinese?
7. What are the licensing and attribution requirements?

## Success Criteria
- Complete feature inventory for both libraries
- Clear understanding of API usage patterns
- Documented strengths and weaknesses of each
- Feature comparison matrix covering all major capabilities
- Informed recommendation for different use case categories

## Time Investment
Approximately 1-2 hours per library for comprehensive analysis.
