# S4-Strategic Approach

## Objective
Assess long-term viability and sustainability of pypinyin and dragonmapper. Move beyond "what works now" to "what will work 3-5 years from now."

## Strategic Questions

### Maintenance & Community
1. How active is the project? (commits, releases, issue response)
2. Who maintains it? (individual, org, community)
3. What's the bus factor? (how many active maintainers?)
4. Is the project financially sustainable?
5. What's the community size and engagement?

### Data Dependencies
6. Where does the pronunciation data come from?
7. Who maintains the data sources?
8. What happens if data sources become unavailable?
9. How are errors in data corrected?
10. How frequently is data updated?

### Ecosystem Position
11. Is this library critical infrastructure for other projects?
12. Are there emerging alternatives?
13. What's the migration path if the library is abandoned?
14. How locked-in are you to this library's API?

### Risk Assessment
15. What are the existential risks to this project?
16. What are the technical debt indicators?
17. How dependent is it on external factors (Unicode updates, etc.)?
18. What's the worst-case scenario?

### Long-Term Planning
19. Should you fork and maintain yourself?
20. Should you contribute upstream?
21. What's the exit strategy if the library dies?
22. Is the licensing future-proof for your needs?

## Methodology

### Quantitative Analysis
- GitHub activity metrics (commits, stars, forks, issues)
- Release cadence and version history
- Contributor counts and diversity
- Download statistics (PyPI)
- Cross-language implementation count

### Qualitative Analysis
- Maintainer communication patterns
- Issue resolution quality and speed
- Community toxicity indicators
- Documentation maintenance
- Technical architecture sustainability

### Comparative Analysis
- pypinyin vs dragonmapper trajectory
- Market alternatives and emergence
- Industry adoption patterns

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of long-term risks
- Informed decision on which library to bet on
- Contingency planning for library obsolescence
- Strategic recommendations for different risk tolerances

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Assuming current maintenance status will continue
- ❌ Ignoring bus factor and key person risk
- ❌ Overlooking data source dependencies
- ❌ Confusing popularity with sustainability
- ❌ Neglecting exit strategy planning
