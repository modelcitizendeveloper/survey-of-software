# S1-Rapid Approach

## Objective
Quick overview of available Python libraries for Pinyin/Zhuyin (Bopomofo) conversion. Rapid assessment of basic capabilities and surface-level differentiation.

## Methodology
1. Web search for each library's PyPI page and documentation
2. Identify core features and conversion capabilities
3. Note Pinyin and Zhuyin support explicitly
4. Quick assessment of maintenance status (latest version, last update)
5. Surface-level comparison of API simplicity

## Libraries Investigated
- **pypinyin** (mozillazg/python-pinyin)
- **dragonmapper** (tsroten/dragonmapper)
- **xpinyin** (lxneng/xpinyin)

**Note**: "python-pinyin" listed in the bead spec is the same library as pypinyin (repository name vs. package name). There is a separate library called "pinyin" (without "py"), but it's not the target of this research.

## Time Investment
Approximately 30-45 minutes per library for initial research and documentation.

## Success Criteria
- Basic understanding of what each library does
- Identification of Pinyin AND Zhuyin support
- Clear enough picture to recommend which library to investigate deeper in S2
