### 2. Limited Restaurant/Service Features

- More to learn than Square's simplicity

### 6. Hardware More Expensive

## Cost Comparison Example

**Hypothetical Scenario:** Retail boutique, online + offline, $50,000/month revenue (50% online, 50% in-store)

### Shopify POS Costs (Monthly)
- Plan (Basic Shopify): $25/mo
- POS Pro: $89/mo
- Processing (2.7% on $50K): $1,350/mo (blended online/offline)
- **Total: ~$1,464/mo** + hardware ($429+ upfront)

### Square Costs (Monthly)
- Software (Retail Plus): $89/mo
- Square Online Store: Included
- Processing (2.6-2.9% on $50K): ~$1,375/mo
- **Total: ~$1,464/mo** + hardware ($299+ upfront)

**Analysis:** Similar total cost, but Shopify offers superior e-commerce platform while Square offers simpler POS. Shopify wins for omnichannel focus.

## Omnichannel Advantages (Shopify's Core Strength)

**Scenarios Shopify Excels:**
1. **Customer buys online, picks up in store** → Inventory automatically reserved, smooth pickup experience
2. **Customer returns online purchase in-store** → Staff process return in POS, customer gets instant refund
3. **Product out of stock in-store** → Staff orders from POS for home delivery from online inventory
4. **Customer loyalty across channels** → Purchases tracked whether online or in-store
5. **Unified gift cards** → Same gift card works online and in all stores
6. **Consistent promotions** → Discount codes work online and in POS

**This is where Shopify POS justifies its higher cost.**

## Next Steps

1. **Start Shopify trial** (e-commerce + POS Lite included)
2. **Set up online store** (even if minimal, to test integration)
3. **Test POS Lite** with in-person sales
4. **Evaluate POS Pro trial** (if available) for advanced features
5. **Calculate total cost** including e-commerce + POS Pro
6. **Compare against competitors** for your specific mix of online/offline
7. **Test omnichannel scenarios** (BOPIS, returns, inventory sync)
