## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Choosing based on lowest monthly fee only**
   → Calculate total cost (software + processing at your volume)

2. **Not testing during free trial**
   → Process real transactions, train staff, evaluate usability

3. **Ignoring contract terms**
   → Check for early termination fees, auto-renewal, commitment length

4. **Overlooking data export capabilities**
   → Verify you can export customer/sales data if you switch later

5. **Underestimating add-on costs**
   → List ALL features needed, get total cost including add-ons

6. **Choosing general-purpose POS for specialized needs**
   → Match POS to business type (Toast for restaurants, Lightspeed for inventory-heavy retail)
