  - "Leiden is faster than Louvain despite extra refinement phase (20x on 39M nodes)"
  - "Louvain suitable for prototyping only - migrate to Leiden before production"
  - "Infomap excels on directed/weighted/temporal/multiplex networks via information theory"
  - "Label Propagation (NetworKit) is only algorithm that scales to >10M nodes"
  - "Spectral Clustering is deterministic but O(n³) limits to <50K nodes"
  - "CDlib provides unified API to 39+ algorithms for comparison and research"
  - "All modularity methods are non-deterministic except Spectral (cluster_qr)"
  - "Quality guarantees matter - Leiden guarantees connected communities (0% disconnected vs 16% for Louvain)"
  - "Algorithm selection depends on graph type: directed→Infomap, undirected→Leiden, huge→Label Prop"
