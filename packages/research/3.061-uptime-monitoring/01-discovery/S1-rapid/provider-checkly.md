### Key Differentiator
Only platform treating monitoring as code-first with Playwright-based browser checks deployable via CLI and Git, enabling developers to version control and code-review their monitoring infrastructure.

### Best For
- Developer teams practicing infrastructure as code
- Projects requiring complex browser automation testing
- Teams already using Playwright for E2E testing
- Modern DevOps workflows with CI/CD integration
- Companies valuing monitoring configuration in Git
- NOT suitable for non-technical users or free tier seekers

### Limitations for MPSE Use Case
- No free tier (eliminates it for zero-cost projects)
- Overkill for simple uptime monitoring
- Requires developer expertise for setup
- Minimum cost $6.41/month (vs free alternatives)
