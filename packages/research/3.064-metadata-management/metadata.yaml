notes: "Fourteenth Tier 3 managed services experiment - Metadata Management & Data Catalog platforms. STATUS: S1-rapid COMPLETE, S2-S4 PENDING. S1 analysis (5 files, ~500 lines) completed covering 3 major open-source platforms: (1) OpenMetadata (recommended for 70% of teams - unified discovery+observability+governance, 84+ connectors, column-level lineage, built-in data quality, managed via Collate); (2) DataHub (best for enterprise governance - 300+ contributors, fine-grained access control, PII tagging, LinkedIn-scale proven, managed via Acryl Data); (3) Amundsen (best for simplicity - 1-3 hour setup, discovery-focused, data preview feature). Also evaluated: Atlan/Alation (commercial), Apache Atlas/Marquez (emerging). Key finding: OpenMetadata offers best feature balance for most teams (4.5/5 rating). PENDING WORK: S2 hands-on deployment testing (8-12 hours), S3 use case matching by team size (6-8 hours), S4 strategic viability analysis (6-8 hours). Total S2-S4 effort: 20-28 hours to complete. Integration with 3.044 Data Warehouse platforms (catalogs sit ON TOP of warehouses). Completed deliverables: STANDARD_EXPLAINER (25KB business concepts), S1-rapid platform comparison, DISCOVERY_TOC. Confidence: MODERATE (7/10) pending hands-on testing."
