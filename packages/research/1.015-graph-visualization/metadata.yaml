    performance: "Desktop tool, 100K+ nodes"
    best_for: Manual exploration, large network analysis
    maturity: "10+ years, desktop-focused, scripting integration limited"

key_findings:
  - finding: "NetworkX + Plotly combination covers 80% of use cases (compute with NetworkX, visualize with Plotly)"
    impact: "Default recommendation for most projects - balances capability and maintainability"

  - finding: "Developer time is 60-80% of total cost, not licensing or infrastructure"
    impact: "Optimize for developer productivity, not license fees. Free vs paid matters less than learning curve."

  - finding: "PyVis excellent for 5-minute demos but medium-high risk for production (vis.js maintenance uncertainty)"
    impact: "Use PyVis for prototypes only, plan migration to Plotly for production deployments"

  - finding: "Domain-specific tools (Cytoscape for biology, Graphviz for docs) outperform general tools in their niches"
    impact: "Use specialized tools when applicable - 10x productivity gain in domain-specific workflows"

  - finding: "Visual chaos threshold: ~500-1000 nodes without aggregation/filtering"
    impact: "Large graphs require sampling strategies, hierarchical views, or interactive filtering"

  - finding: "Static vs interactive is primary decision axis - determines library choice more than any other factor"
    impact: "Choose static (NetworkX/Graphviz) for publications, interactive (Plotly) for dashboards"

  - finding: "Multi-library projects create maintenance burden - commit to one visualization approach"
    impact: "Anti-pattern: mixing PyVis + Plotly + NetworkX matplotlib. Pick one and standardize."

  - finding: "Library viability ranges from A+ (NetworkX, Graphviz) to D+ (PyVis individual-maintained)"
    impact: "3-5 year horizon: NetworkX and Plotly are safe bets. PyVis requires migration planning."

    impact: "Factor learning curve into library selection - simple tools enable faster iteration"

  - finding: "Graph layout algorithms matter more than visualization library for readability"
    impact: "Invest time in layout selection (force-directed, hierarchical, circular) over styling"

completion_notes: |
  Completed February 6, 2026. Comprehensive analysis of graph visualization libraries
  covering the spectrum from quick prototypes (PyVis) to production dashboards (Plotly)
  to domain-specific tools (Cytoscape for biology).

  Key strategic insight: Developer time dominates costs (60-80%), so optimize for
  productivity and long-term maintainability over license fees. NetworkX + Plotly
  combination covers 80% of use cases with excellent viability (A/A+ risk grades).

  Critical finding: PyVis excellent for rapid prototyping (5 minutes to first graph)
  but medium-high risk for production due to individual maintenance. Use for demos
  only, plan migration to Plotly for sustainable deployments.

  Practical impact: Research provides clear decision framework by use case (static vs
  interactive), graph size (1K vs 100K nodes), time horizon (1-2 years tactical vs
  3-5 years strategic), and domain (general vs biological networks).

  S4 DOMAIN_EXPLAINER section makes graph visualization accessible to non-technical
  stakeholders through map metaphors, organizational chart analogies, and subway map
  models. Critical for cross-functional teams where visualization serves communication.
