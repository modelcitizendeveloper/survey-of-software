# S2: Comprehensive Analysis - Graph Visualization Libraries

## Methodology

Deep technical evaluation of graph visualization libraries focusing on architecture, performance characteristics, API design, and feature completeness. Prioritizes understanding implementation details and trade-offs.

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Architecture
- Rendering engine (matplotlib, JavaScript, C/Java backend)
- Layout algorithm implementations
- Data structure design
- Memory footprint

### 2. Performance
- Node/edge scaling limits (practical and theoretical)
- Layout computation speed
- Rendering performance
- Memory consumption patterns

### 3. API Design
- Learning curve assessment
- Integration patterns (NetworkX, Pandas, raw data)
- Customization depth
- Error handling

### 4. Feature Completeness
- Layout algorithms available
- Styling capabilities
- Export formats
- Interactivity features

## Comparison Framework

Libraries evaluated on:
- **Scale:** Maximum graph size (nodes/edges)
