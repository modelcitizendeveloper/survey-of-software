# S3: Need-Driven Discovery - Graph Visualization Libraries

## Methodology

Scenario-based analysis identifying WHO needs graph visualization and WHY. Focuses on real-world use cases to match requirements to optimal library choices.

## Use Case Selection Criteria

Selected use cases spanning:
- **Domains:** Academia, software development, data science, bioinformatics, security
- **Scale:** Small exploratory graphs to massive production networks
- **Output:** Interactive dashboards, static documentation, research publications
- **Technical depth:** Non-programmers to experienced developers

## Use Cases Analyzed

1. **Academic Researcher** - Publishing social network analysis papers
2. **Software Architect** - Documenting microservice dependencies
3. **Data Scientist** - Building interactive network exploration dashboards
4. **Bioinformatician** - Visualizing protein interaction networks
5. **Security Analyst** - Mapping network traffic and threat actors

## Analysis Framework

Each use case evaluated on:
- **Who:** Role, background, constraints
- **Why:** Problem being solved, success criteria
- **Requirements:** Technical needs (scale, interactivity, output format)
- **Recommended path:** Library choice with rationale
- **Alternatives:** When to consider other options

## Validation Approach

Recommendations validated against:
- Real-world project examples (GitHub, research papers)
- Community discussions (Stack Overflow, Reddit, forums)
- Documentation quality for target audience
- Ecosystem maturity for the use case

## Time Investment

- Research time: 2.5 hours
- Read time: 20-30 minutes
- Confidence level: 80%
