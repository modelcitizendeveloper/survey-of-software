# S4: Strategic Selection - Graph Visualization Libraries

## Methodology

Long-term viability assessment for architectural decisions. Focuses on ecosystem health, maintenance outlook, vendor stability, and multi-year considerations beyond immediate technical fit.

## Evaluation Framework

### Ecosystem Health
- **Community size:** Active contributors, download trends
- **Corporate backing:** Commercial support, foundation membership
- **Dependency risk:** Upstream library maintenance status

### Maintenance Outlook
- **Release cadence:** Frequency of updates, bug fixes
- **Security posture:** CVE response time, security audit history
- **Breaking changes:** API stability track record

### Strategic Risks
- **Vendor lock-in:** Migration difficulty if library abandoned
- **Skill availability:** Can you hire developers familiar with this?
- **Ecosystem momentum:** Growing or declining adoption?

### Future-Proofing
- **Technology shifts:** Web standards, browser capabilities, Python evolution
- **Alternative emergence:** New competitors, better approaches
- **Long-term costs:** Maintenance burden, technical debt accumulation

## Libraries Assessed

1. **NetworkX** - Scientific Python foundation
2. **Plotly** - Commercial visualization platform
3. **PyVis** - Community-maintained wrapper
4. **Graphviz** - Legacy C library with Python bindings
5. **py4cytoscape** - Domain-specific desktop integration
6. **Gephi** - Desktop consortium project

## Time Horizon

Strategic assessment targets **3-5 year outlook:**
- What changes might affect viability?
- Which trends favor or threaten each library?
- How hard is migration if needed?

## Confidence Levels

- **High (70-80%):** NetworkX, Plotly, Graphviz (stable, proven)
- **Medium (50-70%):** py4cytoscape, Gephi (niche but established)
- **Lower (40-60%):** PyVis (maintenance uncertainty)

## Time Investment

- Research time: 3 hours
- Read time: 25-35 minutes
- Confidence level: 70% (forward-looking is inherently uncertain)
