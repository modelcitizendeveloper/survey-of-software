## Research Quality Notes

**Strengths:**

- 2025-current information captured

**Limitations:**
- Rapid search = surface-level details on pricing/features

- Product analytics tools (Amplitude, Heap) borderline out-of-scope per S0

**Confidence Level:** High for provider identification, medium for detailed feature/pricing accuracy
