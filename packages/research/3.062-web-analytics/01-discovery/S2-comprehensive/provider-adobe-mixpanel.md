## Why These Aren't Primary Recommendations

**Adobe Analytics:**
- Extremely expensive ($100K-500K/year)
- Overkill for 95% of use cases
- Complex implementation
- Enterprise-only focus

**Mixpanel:**
- Product analytics, not web analytics
- Event-based pricing model (different from pageview-based)
- Better alternatives for simple web tracking
- More suitable for SaaS apps than websites

**When to Consider:**
- **Adobe:** Fortune 500, massive budgets, complex multi-channel needs
- **Mixpanel:** SaaS product with detailed user behavior tracking needs

**For Web Analytics, Use Instead:**
- Privacy-first: Plausible, Fathom, Simple Analytics
- Full-featured: Google Analytics 4, Matomo
- Self-hosted: Umami, Matomo On-Premise
- Enterprise GDPR: Piwik PRO
