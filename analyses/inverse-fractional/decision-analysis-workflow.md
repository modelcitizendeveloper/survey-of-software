- ✅ Implementation roadmap is specific (not generic)
- ✅ Links to research sources are included

1. **Understood**: "Ivan gets my situation"
2. **Informed**: "I learned something new"
3. **Confident**: "I know what to do next"
4. **Empowered**: "I can make this decision myself"

**Indicators of success**:
- Client implements recommendation
- Client refers colleague or books follow-up
- Client provides testimonial
- Client shares report with team/board

---

## Upsell Triggers

### When to Offer Framework Engagement ($5K-12K)

**During consultation, look for**:
- Complex multi-stakeholder decision (board, investors, multiple departments)
- High-stakes outcome (>$100K annual impact)
- Need for board-ready presentation
- Multiple related decisions (HRIS + payroll + time tracking)
- Custom financial modeling needed (TCO calculator, scenario planning)
- Client asks "Can you help us implement this?"

**In report, include**:
- "Next Steps" section mentions Framework Engagement option
- Specific deliverables they'd get (custom models, presentations, methodology docs)
- ROI framing (Framework Engagement pays for itself if decision >$50K annual impact)

**Follow-up email**:
- If client asks detailed implementation questions
- If client wants ongoing advisory
- If client mentions "we have 3 more decisions like this"

---

## Continuous Improvement

### After Each Session, Track

**Operational Metrics**:
- Actual time spent (vs 2.5 hour target)
- Report word count (target: <3,000 words)
- Client response time (did they read it?)
- Follow-up email count (support load)

**Content Opportunities**:
- Can this be anonymized into case study? (invited tier)
- Does this reveal gap in spawn-solutions research? (new experiment)
- Is this a common pattern? (create open tier framework)

**Upsell Tracking**:
- Did client book Framework Engagement? (10% target)
- Did client refer someone? (20% target)
- Did client provide testimonial? (30% target)

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Client Needs More Time (Consultation Runs Over)

**Problem**: 50 minutes not enough, conversation still going at 55 min
**Solution**:
- Politely wrap at 50 min: "We're at time. I have everything I need to deliver your report."
- Offer: "If you want to continue, we can book follow-up call ($200 additional) or upgrade to Framework Engagement."
- Don't: Give away free time (devalues service)

---

### Scenario 2: Client Decision Is Outside Your Expertise

**Problem**: Client asks about decision you haven't researched (e.g., manufacturing ERP for pharma)
**Solution**:
- Be honest: "I haven't researched pharma-specific ERPs, but I can apply my platform selection methodology."
- Offer: "I'll do targeted research for your report (include 30-60 min research time)."
- Alternative: "If you need deep pharma expertise, I can refer you to specialist. Or upgrade to Framework Engagement where I do comprehensive research."
- Don't: Pretend to have expertise you don't (damages credibility)

---

### Scenario 3: Client Just Wants Validation (Already Decided)

**Problem**: Client has already decided, just wants confirmation
**Solution**:
- Acknowledge: "It sounds like you're leaning toward X. Let me pressure-test that."
- Challenge assumptions: "What would make you choose Y instead?"
- Provide value: "Here are 3 risks with X you should mitigate"
- Frame report: "Validation analysis: Why X is right (and what to watch out for)"
- Don't: Just agree (they can get that for free)

---

### Scenario 4: Client Wants Multiple Decisions Analyzed

**Problem**: Client says "We also need to decide on Y and Z"
**Solution**:
- Scope current session: "Let's focus on X for this $200 session."
- Upsell: "For Y and Z, I recommend Framework Engagement ($5K-12K) covering all three decisions with integrated analysis."
- Alternative: "You can book separate $200 sessions for Y and Z, but Framework Engagement gives you better ROI plus custom models."
