# Foundations - Parent project for capability development
#
# This is a parent project that organizes all capability development work:
# - spawn-* ecosystem (spawn, spawn-experiments, spawn-solutions, spawn-analysis)
# - spawn-patents (IP strategy for QRCards)
#
# Children will reference this project via parent_project_id after creation
