# Applications - Parent project for capability application
#
# This is a parent project that organizes all application development work:
# - Large platforms (qrcards, inverse-fractional/learning-lab, SEA)
# - Tools (project-management, cookbooks, elevator-project)
# - Backlog projects (boutique-hotel-recs, business-database, etc.)
#
# Children will reference this project via parent_project_id after creation
