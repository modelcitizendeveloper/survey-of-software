# QRCards Uptime Monitoring Strategic Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Context:** Applying 3.061 Uptime Monitoring findings to QRCards
**Key Question:** Which uptime monitoring service should QRCards implement for production readiness?

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** ✅ Implement UptimeRobot free tier immediately (Week 1, 1 hour setup, $0/month)

**Rationale:**
- QRCards needs: 8 monitors (1 main app + 7 customer subdomains)
- UptimeRobot free tier: 50 monitors, 5-min checks, email + Slack alerts, public status page
- Cost: $0/month (vs StatusCake Superior $20/month or Better Uptime $21/month)
- ROI: $1,425 Year 1 net benefit (time saved detecting outages faster, preventing customer churn)
- Implementation: 1 hour setup (create account, add monitors, configure alerts, set up status page)

**Deferred:** Paid tier upgrade until revenue >$100K/year OR customer SLA contracts require <1 min detection

---

## ✅ Implementation Status

**Decision Made:** UptimeRobot Free Tier (runner-up from assessment, 95/100 score)
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

**Why UptimeRobot over Freshping (97/100 winner)?**
- More established provider (longer track record, founded earlier)
- Familiar interface
- 5-min checks acceptable for current QRCards traffic (not life-critical)
- Same $0/month cost as Freshping

**Public Status Page:** https://stats.uptimerobot.com/6M2Md09UE9
- Name: "ivantohelpyou"
- Initial setup complete (monitoring data populating)

**Next Steps:**
1. Week 2-4: Monitor & learn (track incident patterns, validate PythonAnywhere reliability)
2. Document actual monitors configured (main app + customer subdomains)
3. Configure Slack alerts to #qrcards-ops channel
4. Validate email alerting

---

## Current State

### QRCards Infrastructure
**Deployment:**
- Platform: PythonAnywhere ($19.25/month base + $3/month per subdomain)
- Main app: qrcards.pythonanywhere.com
- Customer subdomains: 7 active trails (trailname.qrcards.app)
- Database: SQLite (admin.db + runtime.db)
- Architecture: Database-driven multi-tenancy (single Flask app routes all domains)

**Current Monitoring:**
- Uptime monitoring: ❌ None
- Application monitoring: ❌ None (Sentry planned per 3.060 assessment)
- Detection method: Customer complaints (reactive, 1-8 hour lag)

**Historical Incidents:**
- No incident tracking (no monitoring in place)
- Manual detection via customer reports only
- Unknown: PythonAnywhere outage frequency, subdomain-specific failures

### Business Context
**Revenue Stage:** Pre-revenue (7 business customers, no formal contracts yet)
**Customer Impact:** Each customer subdomain serves trail QR codes (physical world - cards at trailhead, signage)
**Downtime Cost:**
- User scans QR code → Broken link → Bad experience → Reduced engagement
- Customer (trail organization) may not notice for hours/days (low traffic per trail)
- Founder may not notice (no alerting, reliant on customer reports)
- Physical QR codes printed on signs/cards = can't quickly fix broken links

**SLA Commitments:** None currently (no formal uptime guarantees to customers)

---

## Gaps Analysis

### What QRCards Has
- PythonAnywhere infrastructure (99.5% provider uptime - but doesn't monitor YOUR app)
- Custom subdomain routing (domains table in SQLite)
- Low traffic (downtime impact limited to 7 trails, small user base per trail)

### What QRCards Is Missing (vs Managed Uptime Monitoring)

**1. Proactive outage detection**
- **Current:** Customer reports "site down" → 1-8 hour lag
- **Needed:** 5-min detection (UptimeRobot free tier)
- **Impact:** 115 min faster recovery (5 min vs 2 hour average manual detection)
- **Example:** QR code at trailhead broken Saturday morning → Without monitoring: customer emails Monday (48 hour downtime). With monitoring: Alert in 5 min, fixed in 30 min.

**2. Multi-subdomain monitoring**
- **Current:** No per-customer monitoring (if trailA.qrcards.app down, founder unaware)
- **Needed:** 8 monitors (1 main + 7 customer subdomains)
- **Impact:** Customer subdomain outage (DNS, SSL cert expiration) invisible without monitoring
- **Example:** yosemite.qrcards.app SSL certificate expires overnight → Users see "SSL certificate invalid" error → Customer frustrated, potential churn

**3. Public status page**
- **Current:** No transparency (customers can't check if issue is QRCards or their network)
- **Needed:** status.qrcards.app (public uptime history, incident updates)
- **Impact:** Reduces support burden ("Is the site down?" → "Check status page")
- **Professional credibility:** Shows transparency, builds trust with potential customers

**4. Alert channels**
- **Current:** No alerts (founder discovers downtime randomly or via customer complaint)
- **Needed:** Slack #qrcards-ops channel + email alerts
- **Impact:** 24/7 awareness (phone notification even if not actively checking site)
- **Example:** PythonAnywhere server crashes 2am Saturday → Founder alerted immediately vs discovering Monday morning

**5. Uptime SLA tracking**
- **Current:** No uptime metrics (can't prove reliability to customers)
- **Needed:** Historical uptime reports (last 30/90 days)
- **Impact:** Can market "99.9% uptime" or identify chronic issues
- **Sales enablement:** Show potential customers "We've maintained 99.94% uptime over 90 days"

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Option 1: DIY Uptime Monitoring

**Setup:**
- Cron job on separate server (not PythonAnywhere - don't monitor from same server you're monitoring)
- Python requests library: HTTP GET to 8 endpoints every 5 min
- If timeout or status != 200 → Send Slack webhook + email alert

**Cost:**
- Engineering time: 4-6 hours setup (cron job, alert logic, multi-endpoint config)
- Hosting: $5/month (separate VPS for monitoring cron job - DigitalOcean droplet)
- Maintenance: 1-2 hours/month (email deliverability, monitoring the monitor, adding new customer subdomains)
- **Total Year 1:** (4-6 hr × $150/hr) + $60 hosting + (12-24 hr × $150/hr maintenance) = $600-900 setup + $60 hosting + $1,800-3,600 maintenance = **$2,460-4,560**

**Pros:**
- Full control (no vendor lock-in)
- Custom logic (can add QRCards-specific checks)
- No recurring SaaS fees

**Cons:**
- Single monitoring location (VPS in one region - won't detect regional routing issues)
- No status page (need to build separately - additional 4-6 hours)
- Maintenance burden (every new customer subdomain = update cron job config)
- Cron job server down = monitoring down (who monitors the monitor?)
- Email deliverability issues (SMTP reputation, spam filters)

---

### Option 2: UptimeRobot Free Tier (Recommended)

**Setup:**
- Create account → Add 8 monitors → Configure Slack + email alerts → Set up status page

**Cost:**
- Service: **$0/month** (free tier: 50 monitors, 5-min checks, 10 locations)
- Setup time: 1 hour × $150/hr = $150
- Maintenance: 15 min/quarter (add new customer subdomains as they launch) = 1 hr/year × $150/hr = $150/year
- **Total Year 1:** $150 setup + $0 service fees + $150 maintenance = **$300**

**Features:**
- 50 monitors (QRCards needs 8 → 42 monitors remaining for future growth)
- 5-min check interval (acceptable for QRCards traffic patterns - low traffic, not life-critical)
- 10 global monitoring locations (US, EU, Asia - detects regional routing issues)
- Alert channels: Email (unlimited) + Slack integration
- Public status page (status.qrcards.app via CNAME or subdomain redirect)
- 3-month uptime history (90 days)

**Pros:**
- **$0/month** (vs $20-21 paid alternatives)
- Zero maintenance (vendor handles infrastructure, email deliverability)
- Multi-region monitoring (10 locations vs 1 DIY VPS)
- Status page included (vs 4-6 hours to build DIY)
- Easy to scale (add new customer subdomains in 2 min)
- Reliable alerting (99.99% monitoring uptime)
- 20% acquisition risk (LOW - stable post-MBO ownership, no VC exit pressure)

**Cons:**
- 5-min check interval (vs 1-min paid tier) - acceptable for QRCards (not life-critical, low traffic)
- Free tier limits: 50 monitors (QRCards needs 8 → not a constraint)
- 3-month retention (vs 12 months paid tier) - sufficient for early stage

**QRCards Fit:** **95/100** (perfect for current stage, zero cost, covers all needs)

---

### Option 3: StatusCake Superior ($20/month)

**Why Consider:** Best value-for-money paid tier (from S2 comprehensive discovery)

**Cost:**
- Service: $20/month = **$240/year**
- Setup time: 1 hour × $150/hr = $150
- **Total Year 1:** $150 + $240 = **$390**

**Features:**
- 100 monitors @ 1-min checks (vs 50 monitors @ 5-min UptimeRobot free)
- 30 monitoring locations (vs 10 UptimeRobot free)
- Email + SMS alerts
- Private + public status pages
- Advanced reporting
- SSL monitoring (1 certificate on free tier, unlimited on paid)

**QRCards Fit:** **60/100** (over-engineered for current needs, not worth $240/year vs $0 free tier)

**When to Upgrade:**
- Revenue >$100K/year (downtime cost justifies $240 monitoring)
- OR customer SLA contracts requiring <1 min detection (currently no SLAs)
- OR >50 customer subdomains (exceeds UptimeRobot free tier limit)

---

### Option 4: Better Uptime Superior ($21/month)

**Why Consider:** Best UX, incident management features

**Cost:**
- Service: $21/month = **$252/year**
- Setup time: 1 hour × $150/hr = $150
- **Total Year 1:** $150 + $252 = **$402**

**Features:**
- Unlimited monitors @ 1-min checks
- Incident management (post-mortems, status page updates, subscriber notifications)
- On-call scheduling (PagerDuty-like rotation)
- Email + SMS + phone call alerts
- Beautiful status pages (best-in-class design)

**QRCards Fit:** **55/100** (excellent tool, but over-engineered for solo founder with 7 customers)

**When to Upgrade:**
- 24/7 on-call team (currently solo founder → no rotation needed)
- OR high-frequency incidents requiring post-mortem tracking (currently zero monitoring → unknown incident frequency)
- OR enterprise customers expecting best-in-class incident communication

---

### Option 5: Freshping Free Tier (Alternative Free Option)

**Why Consider:** Faster check intervals (1-min vs 5-min UptimeRobot), great for startups

**Cost:**
- Service: **$0/month** (free tier: 50 monitors, 1-min checks)
- Setup time: 1 hour × $150/hr = $150
- **Total Year 1:** $150 setup + $0 service fees = **$150**

**Features:**
- 50 monitors (same as UptimeRobot)
- 1-min check interval (vs 5-min UptimeRobot) - **2.5x faster detection**
- 10 global monitoring locations
- Native Slack integration
- Public status page (status.qrcards.freshping.io subdomain)
- 90-day retention

**Pros:**
- 1-min checks on free tier (faster than UptimeRobot's 5-min)
- Native Slack integration (vs webhook setup on UptimeRobot)
- 15% acquisition risk (LOW - Freshworks is public company NASDAQ:FRSH)

**Cons:**
- Status page subdomain only (status.qrcards.freshping.io vs custom domain)
- No custom domain for status page on free tier (requires $49/month upgrade)
- Less established than UptimeRobot (acquired 2018, UptimeRobot founded earlier)

**QRCards Fit:** **92/100** (excellent free tier, faster checks than UptimeRobot)

**Recommendation:** Consider Freshping if 1-min checks critical for faster detection (2.5x faster than UptimeRobot 5-min). Both are $0/month, Freshping has slight edge on speed.

- Both $0/month
- Native Slack integration (vs webhook setup)
- Lower acquisition risk (15% vs 20%)

**When to choose UptimeRobot instead:**
- Prefer more established provider (longer track record)
- Already familiar with UptimeRobot interface
- Want custom domain for status page immediately (UptimeRobot Pro $7/month vs Freshping $49/month)

---

## ROI Calculation

### Current State (No Monitoring)
**Average Detection Time:** 2 hours (customer reports issue, founder investigates)
**Incident Frequency:** Unknown (no tracking, assume 1 per quarter = 4/year conservative estimate)

**Downtime Cost Per Incident:**
- User impact: QR code scan → broken link → lost engagement
- Customer impact: Trail organization loses visitor engagement
- Founder impact: 2 hours response time × $150/hour = $300 opportunity cost per incident
- Reputation damage: Unreliable service perception → 1 customer churns = $500 annual contract lost (conservative)

**Annual Cost (No Monitoring):**
- 4 incidents/year × $300 opportunity cost = $1,200/year
- Plus reputation damage: 1 customer churn = $500 annual contract lost
- **Total:** $1,200 + $500 = **$1,700/year cost of no monitoring**

---

### Freshping Free Tier (Recommended)

**Detection Time:** 1 minute (vs 2 hours manual) = **119 min faster**

**Cost:**
- Setup: $150 (1 hour)
- Service: $0/month
- Maintenance: $150/year (1 hour total: 15 min/quarter × 4)
- **Total Year 1:** $150 + $0 + $150 = **$300**

**Savings:**
- Faster detection: 119 min × 4 incidents/year = 476 min/year = 7.93 hours × $150/hr = **$1,190/year saved**
- Reduced reputation damage: Proactive alerting prevents customer-reported downtime = **$500/year saved** (1 customer churn avoided)
- **Total Savings:** $1,190 + $500 = **$1,690/year**

**Net ROI Year 1:**
- Savings: $1,690
- Cost: $300
- **Net Benefit: $1,390**
- **ROI: 463%** ($1,390 benefit / $300 cost)

**Break-Even:** Immediate (1 incident avoided = $300 saved = setup cost covered)

---

### UptimeRobot Free Tier (Alternative)

**Detection Time:** 5 minutes (vs 2 hours manual) = **115 min faster**

**Cost:**
- Setup: $150 (1 hour)
- Service: $0/month
- Maintenance: $150/year (1 hour total)
- **Total Year 1:** $150 + $0 + $150 = **$300**

**Savings:**
- Faster detection: 115 min × 4 incidents/year = 460 min/year = 7.67 hours × $150/hr = **$1,150/year saved**
- Reduced reputation damage: **$500/year saved** (1 customer churn avoided)
- **Total Savings:** $1,150 + $500 = **$1,650/year**

**Net ROI Year 1:**
- Savings: $1,650
- Cost: $300
- **Net Benefit: $1,350**
- **ROI: 450%** ($1,350 benefit / $300 cost)

**Freshping advantage:** $40/year additional benefit due to faster 1-min checks (vs 5-min)

---

## Strategic Considerations (From S4 Discovery)

### Acquisition Risk
**Freshping:** 15% risk (LOW) - Public company parent (Freshworks NASDAQ:FRSH)
- **Implication:** SAFE for 5-10 year commitment
- **Mitigation:** None needed (low risk, public company unlikely to be acquired)

**UptimeRobot:** 20% risk (LOW) - Bootstrapped, entrepreneur-owned, 6 years stable pricing
- **Implication:** SAFE for 5-10 year commitment
- **Mitigation:** None needed (low risk)

**Alternatives:**
- Better Stack (Better Uptime): 50% risk (CAUTION) - VC-backed, exit window 2027-2029
- Pingdom: 85% risk (AVOID) - PE-owned, 2nd acquisition cycle, price increases imminent

**Recommendation:** Freshping or UptimeRobot safe choices (15-20% risk vs 50-85% alternatives)

---

### Lock-In Analysis
**Migration Complexity:** 2-4 hours (8 monitors)
- Export monitor list (manual or API if available)
- Configure new provider (8 monitors × 15 min each = 2 hours)
- Validate alerts + status page
- Cutover

**Mitigation:**
- Document monitor configuration (keep spreadsheet of 8 endpoints + alert channels)
- If provider raises prices or degrades service → migrate to alternative (2-4 hour effort)

**Lock-In Risk:** LOW (easy to migrate, minimal cost)

---

### Pricing Stability
**UptimeRobot Free Tier History:**
- 2018: 50 monitors free
- 2025: 50 monitors free (7 years stable)
- **Trend:** Stable free tier (no erosion)

**Freshping Free Tier History:**
- 2018: Acquired by Freshworks, launched as free tier
- 2025: 50 monitors, 1-min checks free (7 years stable)
- **Trend:** Stable free tier (Freshworks "free forever" commitment)

**Paid Tier Pricing (if QRCards outgrows free tier):**
- UptimeRobot: $7/month (50 monitors, 1-min checks) - unchanged since 2019
- Freshping: $9/month (100 monitors) - stable pricing
- **Trend:** Stable pricing (no inflation)

**Implication:** Low risk of free tier elimination or price increases (unlike VC-backed providers with 20-35% increases 2-3 years pre-exit)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1, Day 1) - 1 Hour

**Step 1: Create Freshping Account** (5 min)
- Sign up: https://www.freshping.io
- Verify email
- Skip paid tier upsell (free tier sufficient)

**Step 2: Add Monitors** (25 min)
- Main app monitor:
  - URL: https://qrcards.pythonanywhere.com
  - Type: HTTPS
  - Interval: 1 minute
  - Name: "QRCards Main App"

- Customer subdomain monitors (7 trails):
  - URLs: trailname.qrcards.app (for each of 7 trails)
  - Type: HTTPS
  - Interval: 1 minute
  - Names: "Trail: [Trail Name]" (e.g., "Trail: Yosemite", "Trail: Yellowstone")

**Step 3: Configure Alerts** (15 min)
- Email alerts: founder email
- Slack integration:
  - Create #qrcards-ops Slack channel (if not exists)
  - Add Freshping incoming webhook
  - Test alert (pause monitor → verify Slack notification)

**Step 4: Set Up Status Page** (10 min)
- Create public status page: Freshping dashboard
- Configure:
  - Show all 8 monitors (main app + 7 customer subdomains)
  - Custom branding: "QRCards System Status"
  - Public URL: https://status.qrcards.freshping.io
  - Alternative: Point status.qrcards.app CNAME to Freshping status page (if supported on free tier)

**Step 5: Validate** (5 min)
- Trigger test alert (pause 1 monitor → confirm email + Slack notification received)
- Check status page (verify all 8 monitors visible, uptime history starts tracking)

**Alternative: UptimeRobot Setup (if choosing UptimeRobot instead)**
- Same steps, replace Freshping with UptimeRobot
- Main difference: 5-min check interval (vs 1-min Freshping)
- Webhook-based Slack integration (vs native in Freshping)

---

### Phase 2: Monitor & Learn (Week 2-4)

**Action:** Observe incident patterns
- Track: How often does PythonAnywhere have issues? (if 0 incidents in 30 days → monitoring validates reliability)
- Track: Which customer subdomains have DNS/SSL issues? (if any)
- Track: Alert fatigue - are 1-min checks too noisy or just right?

**Outcome:** Baseline data for future decisions
- If 0 incidents/month → Validate PythonAnywhere reliability, build customer trust with uptime metrics
- If 2+ incidents/month → Investigate PythonAnywhere stability, consider migration (see 3.040 Database Services for alternatives)

---

### Phase 3: Scale (As New Customers Onboard)

**Trigger:** Each new customer trail launched → Add new monitor

**Process:**
- Customer signs up → Trail subdomain created (newtrail.qrcards.app)
- Add Freshping monitor (2 min):
  - URL: https://newtrail.qrcards.app
  - Interval: 1 min
  - Alert channels: #qrcards-ops + email

**Capacity:** Free tier supports 50 monitors → QRCards can scale to 50 customer trails before hitting limit

---

### Phase 4: Upgrade Decision (Deferred Until Trigger Conditions)

**Trigger Conditions for Upgrading to Paid Tier:**
1. **Revenue >$100K/year**
   - Downtime cost justifies faster detection (30-sec checks vs 1-min)
   - Budget allows $240-252/year monitoring spend

2. **Customer SLA Contracts**
   - Enterprise customer requires 99.9% uptime guarantee
   - SLA penalty clause triggers need for <1 min detection + detailed uptime reports

3. **>50 Customer Trails**
   - Exceeds free tier limit (50 monitors)
   - Options: Freshping paid ($9/month, 100 monitors) or StatusCake Superior ($20/mo, 100 monitors)

**Until Then:** Stay on free tier (zero cost, covers all needs)

---

## Recommendation

### Immediate Action (Week 1) — ✅ COMPLETED 2025-10-31

✅ **UptimeRobot free tier implemented** (alternative to Freshping recommendation)

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1, Day 1 (1 hour):** Setup (create account, add monitors, configure alerts, status page) — ✅ DONE
- **Week 2-4:** Monitor & learn (track incidents, validate PythonAnywhere reliability) — IN PROGRESS

**Cost:** $0/month, $300 Year 1 total (setup + maintenance)

**ROI:** $1,350 Year 1 net benefit (450% ROI) based on UptimeRobot 5-min checks

**Alignment with CTO Technical Readiness Assessment:**
- CTO Assessment Week 1 Priority: "Uptime monitoring (4-6 hours, $0-10/month)"
- This Implementation: UptimeRobot (1 hour, $0/month) → **Exceeds CTO Assessment expectations** (faster setup, zero cost)

**Assessment Note:** Original recommendation was Freshping (97/100, 1-min checks), but UptimeRobot (95/100, 5-min checks) selected for more established provider track record. Both are $0/month free tier.

---

### Deferred Actions

⏸️ **Paid tier upgrade** (StatusCake Superior $20/mo or Better Uptime $21/mo)
- **Defer until:** Revenue >$100K/year OR customer SLA contracts OR >50 trails
- **Estimated timeline:** 12-24 months (need 10-20 paying customers at $5-10K/year each)

⏸️ **Enterprise monitoring** (Datadog Synthetics, Pingdom)
- **Defer until:** Multi-region deployments OR complex API testing requirements
- **Estimated timeline:** 24-36 months (scale-up stage, 100+ customers)

---

## Cross-Experiment Integration

### 3.060 Application Monitoring (Sentry) Synergy
**Complementary Tools:**
- Uptime monitoring (Freshping/UptimeRobot): Detects "site down" (server crash, network issue)
- Application monitoring (Sentry): Detects "site broken" (500 errors, exceptions within running app)

**Combined Implementation:**
- Week 1: Freshping (1 hour) + Sentry (45 min) = **1.75 hours total setup, $0/month**
- Coverage: External outages + internal errors = complete monitoring

**Key Difference:**
- Freshping detects: PythonAnywhere server completely down
- Sentry detects: Database query error on line 247 (app running, but broken)
- **You need BOTH** for comprehensive monitoring

---

### 3.040 Database Services (Deferred)
**Future Decision:** If uptime monitoring reveals frequent PythonAnywhere incidents → Consider migration
- Current: SQLite on PythonAnywhere
- Alternative: Supabase, Neon, PlanetScale (managed PostgreSQL with higher reliability)
- Decision criteria: If >2 incidents/month for 3 consecutive months → revisit hosting

---

### 2.001+2.020 Service Subtraction Strategy Validation
**Pattern Confirmed:** QRCards avoids complexity by deferring until proven necessary
- Don't implement monitoring until production (deferred pre-launch)
- Don't pay for monitoring until revenue justifies (free tier until $100K/year)
- Don't over-engineer (Freshping free tier vs Better Uptime enterprise features)

---

## Appendix: Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: QRCards Launches Self-Serve Signup (Future)

**Change:** Users can create trails directly (vs current: business sales only)

**Impact:**
- Customer growth: 7 trails → 50 trails in 6 months
- Monitoring need: 8 monitors → 50 monitors (still within free tier)
- Alert fatigue risk: 50 customer subdomains × incidents = potentially noisy alerts

**Recommendation:**
- Stay on Freshping free tier (50 monitors = sufficient)
- Configure alert grouping (if 5+ monitors down simultaneously = infrastructure issue, single alert)
- When >50 trails: Upgrade to Freshping paid ($9/month, 100 monitors) or StatusCake Superior ($20/mo, 100 monitors)

---

### Scenario B: QRCards Adds API for Third-Party Integrations (Future)

**Change:** Expose API for partners to integrate QRCards trail data

**Impact:**
- New monitoring need: API endpoint uptime + response time + rate limits
- Current tools insufficient: Freshping/UptimeRobot monitors HTTP 200, doesn't test POST requests with auth tokens

**Recommendation:**
- Switch to Checkly ($6.41/mo) - Monitoring as Code, API testing (POST/PUT/DELETE with headers)
- Or add Checkly for API monitoring (complementary to Freshping for website monitoring)
- Checkly acquisition risk: 55% (CAUTION - VC-backed, exit pressure 2027-2028)

---

### Scenario C: Enterprise Customer Requires 99.95% Uptime SLA

**Change:** Customer contract specifies 99.95% uptime (21.6 min/month downtime budget)

**Impact:**
- 1-min checks insufficient (1 min detection + 5 min fix = 6 min downtime per incident = 3.5 incidents/month max)
- Need: 30-sec checks (30 sec detection + 5 min fix = 5.5 min per incident = 4 incidents/month allowable)

**Recommendation:**
- Upgrade to Better Uptime Superior ($21/mo) - 30-sec checks
- Or StatusCake Superior ($20/mo) - 1-min checks (if 1-min sufficient)
- Cost justified: $240-252/year << enterprise contract value ($10K-50K/year)

---

**Final Thought:** Start with Freshping free tier (Week 1), monitor for 90 days, then revisit based on actual incident patterns. Don't over-engineer upfront.
