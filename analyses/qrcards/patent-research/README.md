## Key Differentiators (Our Novelty)

**No prior art combines:**

1. **QR Code Mass Registration** - Instant enrollment for 1000+ without hardware/app
2. **WebSocket Bidirectional Sync** - Real-time server↔device over internet
3. **Pre-Loaded Content Model** - Download-then-trigger (not streaming)
4. **Time-Code Triggering** - Automated discrete triggers (not continuous)
5. **Live Event Participation** - Coordinated actions, not passive viewing
6. **BYOD Web Approach** - No hardware, no app download

**This combination is novel and patentable.**

## Recommended Patent Claims (Core)

**Independent Claim 1 (Method):**

> A computer-implemented method for synchronizing multimedia content display across a plurality of user devices at a live event venue, comprising:
> - Generating event-specific enrollment identifier encodable as machine-scannable code
> - Receiving enrollment requests from devices via internet (initiated by scanning code)
> - Transmitting content assets to enrolled devices for local storage in advance of display
> - Determining time-code trigger signals corresponding to event timeline moments
> - Broadcasting triggers via bidirectional internet communication channel
> - Causing enrolled devices to substantially simultaneously display pre-loaded content
> - Wherein simultaneous display creates coordinated audience experience at live event venue

**Key Language Differentiating from Prior Art:**
- "Live event venue" (not broadcast TV, home viewing)
- "Machine-scannable code" (generic, not QR-specific)
- "Local storage in advance" (pre-loaded, not streamed)
- "Time-code trigger signals" (discrete, not continuous)
- "Bidirectional internet" (two-way, internet-based)

## Financial Analysis

### Investment
- **Provisional (Year 1):** $2,500
- **Full Utility (Year 2):** $15,000-$20,000 (if pursued)
- **Maintenance (20 years):** $12,000
- **Total Lifecycle:** $30,000-$35,000

### Expected Value
- **Success (70%):** $200K value → ROI 2x-10x
- **Moderate (20%):** $35K value → ROI 1x-2x
- **Failure (10%):** -$35K loss → ROI 0x
- **Expected Value:** +$143.5K
- **Net (after $30K cost):** **+$113.5K positive**

**Conclusion:** Positive expected value supports filing.
