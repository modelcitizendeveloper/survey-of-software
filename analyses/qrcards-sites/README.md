# QRCards Sites - Vikunja Projects

**Each YAML file creates a separate Vikunja project for each QRCards-generated site**

---

## Structure

```
qrcards-sites/
├── ivantohelpyou.yaml              → Creates "IvanToHelpYou" project in Vikunja
├── model-citizen-developer.yaml    → Creates "Model Citizen Developer" project
├── convention-city-seattle.yaml    → Creates "Convention City Seattle" project
├── inverse-fractional.yaml         → Creates "Inverse Fractional" project
├── taelyen.yaml                    → Creates "Taelyen" project
└── README.md                       → This file
```

**Result in Vikunja**: 5 separate projects, one per site

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Bootstrap GTD Labels (One-time)

```bash
cd ~/spawn-solutions/research/1.131-project-management/02-implementations/vikunja-populate-script/src

# Create all GTD labels (run ONCE)
python populate_vikunja.py ~/spawn-solutions/applications/00-bootstrap-labels.yaml

# Then delete the "GTD Labels System" project in Vikunja UI
# (labels remain, only project is deleted)
```

### Step 2: Create All Site Projects

```bash
# Option A: Create all sites at once
cd ~/spawn-solutions/applications/qrcards-sites
./populate-all-sites.sh

# Option B: Create one site at a time
cd ~/spawn-solutions/research/1.131-project-management/02-implementations/vikunja-populate-script/src
python populate_vikunja.py ~/spawn-solutions/applications/qrcards-sites/ivantohelpyou.yaml
python populate_vikunja.py ~/spawn-solutions/applications/qrcards-sites/model-citizen-developer.yaml
# ... etc
```

### Step 3: GTD Capture for Each Site

After projects are created, go to each site in Vikunja and add specific tasks:

**IvanToHelpYou**:
- Update consulting services page
- Add new speaking engagement
- Write blog post about X
- Update portfolio

**Model Citizen Developer**:
- Write tutorial on Power Apps
- Update community resources
- Record video walkthrough

**Convention City Seattle**:
- Add upcoming conventions
- Update venue information
- Contact new venues

---

## Workflow

### Initial Setup (Now)
1. Bootstrap labels
2. Create all 5 site projects
3. Initial GTD capture (1 task per project to review content)

### Ongoing (Weekly)
1. During Weekly Review: Check each site project
2. Add new tasks as content ideas arise
3. Use GTD labels to organize:
   - `@Quick` - Quick content updates (<30 min)
   - `@Computer` - Full content creation (1-2 hours)
   - `@DeepWork` - Major site redesigns
   - `Writing` - Content creation
   - `Next Action` - Ready to work on

### Portfolio View (Monthly)
```bash
# Export all site projects
cd ~/spawn-solutions/research/1.131-project-management/02-implementations/vikunja-export-script/src
python export_vikunja.py --output ~/spawn-analysis/sites-portfolio.md

# Shows velocity across all sites:
# - IvanToHelpYou: 1.5 tasks/week
# - Model Citizen Developer: 0.8 tasks/week
# - Convention City Seattle: 0.2 tasks/week (stalled?)
# ... etc
```

## QRCards Integration

**Sites are generated by QRCards**:
- Content stored in `~/qrcards/content/<site-name>`
- Generated output in `~/qrcards/output/<site-name>`
- Configuration in `~/qrcards/configs/<site-name>.yaml`

**Workflow**:
1. Update content in Vikunja task
2. Edit markdown files in `~/qrcards/content/<site-name>`
3. Run QRCards generator
4. Deploy updated site
5. Mark Vikunja task as done

**Example**:
```bash
# Task: "Add new blog post to IvanToHelpYou"
# 1. Mark "In Progress" in Vikunja
# 2. Create content
cd ~/qrcards/content/ivantohelpyou
# edit files...

# 3. Generate site
cd ~/qrcards
./launch <config>

# 4. Deploy (if needed)
# 5. Mark task done in Vikunja
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Bootstrap labels** (if not done): Run 00-bootstrap-labels.yaml
2. **Populate all sites**: Run populate-all-sites.sh
3. **Initial capture**: Complete the "GTD Capture" task in each project
4. **Add real tasks**: Based on each site's roadmap/content gaps
5. **Weekly review**: Check sites during Monday Weekly Review

**Status**: Ready to populate
**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Projects**: 5 QRCards sites
