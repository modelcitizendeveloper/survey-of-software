      <strong>Goal:</strong> Capture platform-level work (not individual spawn-* projects)<br><br>
      <strong>Steps:</strong><br>
      - Review README.md (platform overview)<br>
      - Review STRATEGIC_VISION.md<br>
      - Check for cross-project integration work<br>
      - Document any platform-level decisions needed<br><br>
      <strong>Note:</strong><br>
      Individual spawn-* projects have their own tasks:<br>
      - spawn-experiments (separate project)<br>
      - spawn-solutions (separate project)<br>
      - spawn-analysis (separate project)<br><br>
      This project is for platform-wide coordination only.<br><br>
