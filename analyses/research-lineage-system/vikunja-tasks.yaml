      <strong>Goal:</strong> Understand where we are with this project and how much has been built<br><br>
      <strong>Context:</strong><br>
      - Started with basic metadata tracking<br>
      - Need to evaluate: where are we with this? how much is done?<br><br>
      <strong>Folder location:</strong> ~/spawn-solutions/applications/research-lineage-system/<br><br>
      <strong>Assessment questions:</strong><br>
      - What metadata is currently being tracked?<br>
      - What systems or code exist?<br>
      - Is there a database or data model?<br>
      - What was the original intent/vision?<br>
      - What remains to be built?<br>
      - Is this still valuable or should it be archived?<br><br>
      <strong>Steps:</strong><br>
      - Review folder contents thoroughly<br>
      - Check for any code, schemas, or data files<br>
      - Look for README or design documents<br>
      - Evaluate completeness (10%? 50%? 90%?)<br>
      - Determine if it's serving its purpose<br>
      - Identify gaps or missing components<br><br>
      <strong>Deliverables:</strong><br>
      - Current state assessment document<br>
      - Decision: continue, pause, or archive?<br>
      - If continuing: Complete task list for remaining work<br>
      - If pausing: Document reasons and restart conditions<br>
      - If archiving: Document what was learned
