```
Retail price:      $20.00
Print cost:        -$8.00  (to print partner)
Gross margin:      $12.00
├─ Hotel (70%):    $8.40
└─ mztape (30%):   $3.60
```

## Order Fulfillment Models

### Model 1: Single-Order Marketplace Sales

**How it works:**
1. Customer browses guidebooks.mztape.com
2. Customer orders "Hotel Ballard Guide" ($20)
3. mztape receives order, processes payment
4. mztape sends order to Blurb via API
5. Blurb prints, ships direct to customer
6. Customer receives book (5-7 days)
7. mztape pays hotel 70% minus print cost

**Economics:**
```
Customer pays:        $20.00
├─ Print (Blurb):     $10.00
├─ Shipping:          $4.00 (customer pays separately)
└─ Margin:            $10.00
    ├─ Hotel:         $7.00 (70%)
    └─ mztape:        $3.00 (30%)

mztape revenue: $3.00/book
mztape cost: $0 (dropship)
mztape profit: $3.00/book (100% margin)
```

**Customer experience:**
- Order on mztape site or hotel website (embedded widget)

---

### Model 2: Hotel Bulk Orders (Inventory)

1. Hotel orders 100 books via dashboard
2. mztape processes order with PrintNinja
3. Books ship to hotel (bulk rate)
4. Hotel manages inventory, sells in lobby
5. No revenue share (hotel owns inventory)

**Economics:**
```
Hotel orders 100 books:
├─ Print cost:        $8/book × 100 = $800
├─ Shipping:          $50 (bulk)
└─ Total:             $850

Hotel sells in lobby:
├─ Retail:            $20/book
├─ Sold:              80 books (20% stay as hotel amenity)
├─ Revenue:           $1,600
└─ Profit:            $750 (88% margin)

mztape revenue: $0 (hotel owns inventory)
mztape could charge: $50 printing fee (5-10% of order)
```

4. Hotel uses as swag/marketing collateral
5. mztape charges printing fee or referral fee

**Economics:**
```
Hotel orders 500 books:
├─ Print cost:        $6/book × 500 = $3,000
├─ Shipping:          $150 (bulk)
└─ Total:             $3,150

mztape fee options:
├─ Option A: 10% referral fee = $315
├─ Option B: Flat $500 coordination fee

Annual volume:        600 books
Retail revenue:       $12,000
Print cost:           $6,000 (600 × $10)
Hotel profit:         $6,000 (after 70/30 split)

---

### Platform Economics (100 Hotels)

**Assume: 50% of hotels print guidebooks by Year 2**

**50 hotels printing (average 50 lobby sales/month):**
```
Annual volume:        30,000 books (50 hotels × 600 books)
Total retail:         $600,000
Print cost:           $300,000
Hotel profit:         $300,000 total ($6,000/hotel)
mztape revenue:       $90,000/year
```

**Marketplace sales (avg 10 books/hotel/month):**
```
Annual volume:        6,000 books (50 hotels × 120 books)
Total retail:         $120,000
Print cost:           $60,000
Hotel profit:         $42,000 total
mztape revenue:       $18,000/year
```

**Bulk orders (10 hotels order 500 books for events):**
```
Annual volume:        5,000 books
Hotel cost:           $30,000 (print)
mztape referral fee:  $3,000 (10%)
```

**Total mztape print revenue: $111,000/year**

### Margin Analysis

**mztape print revenue breakdown:**

| Channel | Volume/year | mztape revenue/book | Total |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Lobby sales (dropship) | 30,000 | $3 | $90,000 |
| Marketplace sales | 6,000 | $3 | $18,000 |
| Bulk orders (referral) | 5,000 | $0.60 | $3,000 |
| **Total** | **41,000** | **~$2.70 avg** | **$111,000** |

**mztape costs:**
- Print fulfillment: $0 (dropship via Blurb/Lulu)
- Payment processing: 3% of retail = ~$21,600
- Platform/hosting: $500/month = $6,000
- Customer service: 0.5 FTE = $30,000
- **Total costs: $57,600**

**Net profit: $53,400 (48% margin)**

---

### Scaling Economics (Year 5: 500 Hotels)

**250 hotels printing guidebooks:**

| Channel | Volume/year | Revenue |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Lobby sales | 150,000 books | $450,000 |
| Marketplace | 30,000 books | $90,000 |
| Bulk orders | 50,000 books | $30,000 |
| **Total** | **230,000** | **$570,000** |

**Costs at scale:**
- Payment processing: $108,000
- Platform: $12,000
- Customer service: 2 FTE = $120,000
- **Total costs: $240,000**

**Net profit: $330,000 (58% margin)**

**Profit per hotel: $1,320/year** (vs $948 SaaS revenue/hotel)
→ Print revenue = **1.4x SaaS revenue**

---

## Customer Acquisition via Guidebook

### Virality Mechanism

**Guidebook as marketing:**
1. Hotel publishes guidebook
2. Guidebook ranks in Google ("best romantic Seattle")
3. Traveler finds guidebook, reads content
4. Traveler thinks: "This hotel knows Seattle, I should book here"
5. Traveler books hotel
6. Traveler buys print guidebook in lobby
7. Traveler shares guidebook with friends
8. Friends google "Hotel Ballard guidebook"
9. Friends discover mztape platform
10. Friends are hotel owners → New customer acquired

**CAC calculation:**
```
Traditional SaaS CAC: $500-2,000 (sales, marketing)

Guidebook-driven CAC:
- 100 guidebooks published
- Each ranks for 50 keywords
- 10,000 pageviews/month across all guidebooks
- 1% of readers are hotel owners (100/month)
- 10% inquire about platform (10/month)
- 50% convert (5/month)
- CAC = $0 (organic discovery)

Annual new customers: 60 hotels
Value: 60 × $948 SaaS = $56,880
```

**The guidebook IS the marketing:**
- No paid ads needed
- SEO value compounds over time
- Social proof (real hotel guidebooks)
- Word-of-mouth (hoteliers share with each other)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Print quality issues

**Mitigation:**
- Pilot with 10 hotels, 100 books before scaling
- Order samples from each print partner
- Quality checklist (binding, color, paper, alignment)
- Money-back guarantee for defects
- Switch partners if quality poor

### Risk 2: Hotels don't sell enough books (inventory sits)

**Mitigation:**
- Default to single-order dropship (no inventory risk)
- Bulk orders are opt-in (hotel chooses to invest)
- Recommend: Start with 25 books, reorder if sold out
- Provide sales guidance: "50% of guests buy if displayed at desk"

### Risk 3: Shipping costs eat margin

**Mitigation:**
- Customer pays shipping separately (marketplace)
- Bulk orders: Hotel pays shipping (built into order)
- Negotiate flat-rate shipping with print partner
- Target: $4-5 shipping per book (customer pays)

### Risk 4: Print partner goes out of business / API breaks

**Mitigation:**
- Use 2 partners (Blurb + Lulu) for redundancy
- Export print-ready PDFs (hotel can print anywhere)
- Contract with local printer as backup
- Hotels own their content (can switch printers anytime)

---

## Success Metrics

### Platform Metrics

**Month 18 (Pilot):**
- 10 hotels with published guidebooks
- 500 books printed/month

- 250 hotels with published guidebooks
- 20,000 books printed/month
- $50,000 mztape revenue/month
- Profit: $30,000/month (60% margin)

---

## Recommendation

**Start with digital publishing (Month 12), add print later (Month 15+)**

**Why:**
1. Prove concept with digital first (free to hotels, low risk)
2. Build print pipeline once demand validated
3. Print revenue is bonus (not required for business model)
4. Hotels value export feature regardless of print fulfillment

**Pricing approach:**
- Never charge hotels for PDF export (their data)
- Charge 30% margin on print fulfillment (service fee)
- Offer bulk printing referrals (10% fee) for cost savings

**Result:**
- Hotels trust platform (data portability)
- mztape earns additional revenue (print margin)
- Print becomes marketing channel (guidebook discovery → new customers)

---

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Define print-on-demand economics, revenue model, and fulfillment strategy
**Timeline:** Month 15+ (after digital publishing proven)
**Key Finding:** Print revenue can equal or exceed SaaS revenue ($1,320/hotel/year print vs $948/year SaaS)
