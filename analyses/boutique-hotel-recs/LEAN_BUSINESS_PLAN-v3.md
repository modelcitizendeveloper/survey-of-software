Lean Business Plan: mztape™ for guests

Company Name
mztape™
Multidimensional Mixtape Metaphor
Core Concept: "Curated recommendations, like a mixtape for your trip"
Why This Works for Hotels:
Nostalgia: Mixtapes = personal curation, care, thoughtfulness
Authenticity: Hotels curate local favorites (not algorithm-generated)
Personalization: Each "tape" (card) unique to guest
Marketing Copy Examples:
"Remember making mixtapes? mztape is that—but for local recommendations."
"Your hotel's local favorites, curated like a mixtape, delivered via QR card."
"Not a generic playlist. A mixtape made just for you."

Problem
Boutique hotels (20-100 rooms) face a critical guest experience challenge:
Time-consuming manual process: Front desk staff spend 10-30 minutes per guest handwriting notes, printing Google Maps, or providing verbal directions - consuming 20-30 hours per month of staff time
Inconsistent quality: Different staff members give different recommendations, creating inconsistent guest experiences
No personalization at scale: Hotels can personalize for VIP guests but lack systems to personalize for all guests
No tracking or learning: Hotels don't know which recommendations guests love, which restaurants have declined in quality, or how to improve over time
Competitive pressure: Boutique hotels compete on authentic local experiences but have no tools to scale this differentiator against chains and Airbnb
The core issue: Hotels want to give every guest the VIP treatment but lack the time and tools to do so.

Our solution
mztape™ for guests helps boutique hotels give every guest instant personalized local recommendations. It's easy for non-technical staff, turnkey for hotels, and frictionless for guests.
Simple set-up: Pre-printed professional cards show a dynamic QR code that links to local recommendations out of the box. Hotels can also configure custom cards for any guest type (romantic couple, family, business traveler) and personalize recommendations for each guest.
How it works: Staff members hand guests a pre-printed card matched to their interests. Guests scan to see recommendations with photos, maps, and directions—no app needed. If guests want something specific, staff can add it to their card in under a minute and it updates automatically.

Two key innovations:
1. Fast Staff Workflow
Pick a card and hand it to the guest. That's it. The card has your top recommendations.
Give your guest themed cards for dining, nightlife, sports, culture – whatever you want.
Curate personalized recommendations and add it to the card – hand it to them on check-in, or leave it in the room.

2. Privacy-first approach
QRCards is privacy-first by design, not as an afterthought.
Traditional recommendation systems require:
❌ App installation
❌ Account creation
❌ Login credentials
❌ Location tracking
❌ Check-ins
❌ Personal data collection
QRCards requires NONE of these.
Our Approach:
✅ Physical cards (tangible keepsake guests can take home)
✅ Digital mobile experience (scan QR code → instant access)
✅ Privacy-first (no guest login, no tracking by default)
✅ Hospitality-specific workflow (staff conversations, not surveillance)
Result: Guests get personalized recommendations without sacrificing privacy. Hotels get feedback loop without creepy tracking.

Revenue streams
Primary Revenue: Monthly Subscriptions (SaaS)
Tier Structure:
Basic ($39/month): Laminated sheet with 12-20 QR codes - print once, same recommendations for all guests
Starter ($79/month): 52-card deck (playing card style) - staff picks card based on guest type (romantic/family/business) without online customization
Professional ($129/month): 52-card deck + online customization - edit recommendations per guest for maximum personalization
Premium: $229/month (101-200 room hotels) - Multi-property, API access, white-label
Average Revenue Per Hotel: $79/month blended (60% Starter, 20% Basic, 20% Professional)
Revenue Projections:
Year 1: 100 hotels × $79 avg = $7,900 MRR = $95K ARR
Year 2: 350 hotels × $119 avg = $41,650 MRR = $500K ARR
Year 3: 800 hotels × $125 avg = $100,000 MRR = $1.2M ARR
Path to $1M ARR: 1,055 hotels × $79 avg = $83,333 MRR (achievable Month 9-12)
Secondary Revenue (Year 2+):
Add-ons: Card refills ($100 per 100 cards), setup service ($500), Property Management Service (PMS) integration ($1,000 one-time)
Annual discounts: 2 months free (upfront cash, reduced churn)
Publishing platform (Month 12+): Hotels publish guidebooks digitally + print-on-demand, 30% revenue share on print sales
Adjacent markets: Vacation rentals ($49/month), event venues ($199/event or $499/month unlimited)
Unit Economics:
LTV: $79 × 12 months / 60% annual churn = $237 (conservative) to $948 (optimistic with 5% monthly churn)
CAC: $50-150 (direct outreach/demos), lower with product-led growth
LTV:CAC ratio: 2.4:1 to 9:1 (healthy SaaS economics)
Gross margin: 99% (software, no physical fulfillment for most tiers)

The competition
Who are your competitors
Direct Competitors (Hospitality Platforms):
TouchStay ($20-100/month): Static guidebooks for vacation rentals - not personalized per guest, vacation rental-focused not hotels
GuestJoy ($99-299/month): SMS-based pre-arrival messaging - no physical cards, expensive
Canary Technologies ($300+/month): Enterprise guest management - overkill for boutique hotels, complex setup, expensive
Generic QR platforms ($15-50/month): Beaconstac, QR Code Generator PRO - not hospitality-specific, requires manual setup per guest
Indirect Competitors (DIY Alternatives):
Custom development (Supabase/Firebase): $6,000 upfront + ongoing maintenance
WordPress + plugins: $1,000 setup + $25-50/month, clunky admin
Airtable + Softr: $58/month + $500 setup, generic not hospitality-optimized
