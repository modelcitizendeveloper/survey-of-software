# Boutique Hotel ICP: Marketing Overview

**Target Market Shift:** DMOs/Convention Centers → Boutique Hotels

---

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): Boutique Hotels

### Demographics

**Firmographics:**
- **Property size:** 20-100 rooms (small enough for personalization, large enough for budget)
- **Property type:** Independent boutique hotels, small chains (2-5 properties), luxury B&Bs
- **Location:** Tourist destinations (downtown urban, coastal towns, wine country, mountain resorts)
- **Annual revenue:** $1M-10M (enough budget for guest experience tools)
- **Guest volume:** 5-20 check-ins/day (150-600 guests/month)

**Geographic Focus:**
- **Primary:** US West Coast (Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, San Diego, wine country)
- **Secondary:** US tourist destinations (Charleston, Napa, Asheville, Santa Fe, Key West)
- **Tertiary:** International boutique hotel clusters (Europe, Australia, Japan)

---

### Psychographics

**Hotel Philosophy:**
- **Guest experience obsessed:** Differentiates on personalized service, not just amenities
- **Authentic local:** Prides themselves on insider knowledge of neighborhood
- **Anti-chain:** Actively positions against "generic" big hotel experience
- **Design-conscious:** Curated aesthetic, Instagram-worthy spaces
- **Sustainability-minded:** Supports local businesses, eco-friendly practices

**Pain Points:**
- **Manual recommendation process:** Staff spends 10-30 min per guest handwriting notes, printing Google Maps
- **Inconsistent quality:** Different staff members give different recommendations
- **No tracking:** Hotel doesn't know if guests actually use recommendations
- **Wasted opportunity:** Great recommendations create loyalty, but no system to scale this
- **Competitive pressure:** Competing with Airbnb (which has local guides), big hotel chains (which have concierge apps)

**Goals:**
- **Differentiation:** Stand out from chains with authentic local connections
- **Efficiency:** Save staff time without sacrificing personalization
- **Guest satisfaction:** Higher review scores, repeat bookings, referrals
- **Local partnerships:** Strengthen relationships with nearby restaurants/shops (mutual referrals)

---

### Decision-Making Unit

**Primary Decision Maker:**
- **General Manager (GM)** or **Owner/Operator** (boutique hotels often owner-operated)
- Budget authority: $100-500/month discretionary spend
- Cares about: Guest satisfaction scores, staff efficiency, occupancy rates
- Tech-savvy: Comfortable with digital tools, but prefers simple/turnkey solutions

**Influencers:**
- **Front Desk Manager:** Daily user of recommendation system, needs easy workflow
- **Concierge:** Wants tool that makes them look knowledgeable (vs replaces them)
- **Marketing Manager:** Wants analytics to track guest engagement, improve offerings

**Gatekeepers:**
- **IT/Operations:** Rarely a blocker (boutique hotels don't have complex IT requirements)
- **Ownership/Investors:** May need ROI justification if >$200/month spend

---

### Buying Behavior

**Purchase Timeline:**
- **Awareness → Interest:** 1-2 weeks (see demo, like concept)
- **Interest → Evaluation:** 2-4 weeks (test with 5-10 guests, collect feedback)
- **Evaluation → Purchase:** 1-2 weeks (get GM/owner approval)
- **Total: 4-8 weeks** from first contact to signed contract

**Budget Cycle:**
- **Discretionary spend:** Can purchase anytime (monthly budget)
- **Annual planning:** Q4 (November-December) for next year's guest experience initiatives
- **Best time to sell:** Q1 (January-March) to launch for summer season, Q4 for annual budget planning

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Ease of use:** Staff must be able to use it without training
2. **Guest experience:** Must feel personal, not automated
3. **Cost:** Must save more staff time than it costs
4. **Branding:** Must look professional, match hotel aesthetic
5. **Speed to launch:** Want to use it within 2-4 weeks (not 3-6 months)

- Guest complaint: "Front desk recommended restaurant that was closed"

**How She Adopts:**

- **Wants:** System that makes her look good (not replaces her expertise)
- **Fears:** "Will this make me obsolete?" → Needs reassurance it enhances her role
