## Page 6: About (/about)

### Purpose
Build trust, explain origin story, humanize brand

### Hero

**Headline:**
```
We help hotels deliver authentic local experiences—
without the time investment
```

**Subheadline:**
```
mztape was born from a simple observation: Boutique hotels compete on
personal touch, but front desks don't have 30 minutes per guest to
handwrite recommendations and print Google Maps.
```

---

### Origin Story

**The Problem We Saw:**
```
Boutique hotels pride themselves on authentic local connections.
But the traditional workflow—handwritten notes, printed directions,
verbal recommendations—doesn't scale.

Result:
• Quality varies by staff member
• New employees don't know neighborhood gems
• No way to track if guests actually use recommendations
• Chain hotels win on convenience (even if they lack authenticity)
```

**Our Solution:**
```
What if you could deliver concierge-quality recommendations in
3 minutes instead of 30?

That's mztape: Pre-printed QR cards + your curated local favorites
= personalized recommendations at scale.
```

---

### Our Mission

**Vision:**
```
Every boutique hotel guest receives authentic local recommendations—
not generic Google reviews, not chain restaurant suggestions,
but the hidden gems your staff actually loves.
```

**Values:**

## Branding Guidelines

### Logo Concepts

**Option 1: "mz" Monogram**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   ╔═╗       │
│   ║ ║╔═╗    │   mztape™
│   ║ ║╚═╝    │
│   ╚═╝       │
└─────────────┘
```
- Modern, geometric, minimal
- "mz" letterforms interlocked
- Works at small sizes (favicon, mobile)

**Option 2: Tape Cassette Icon**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   ╔═══╗     │
│   ║ ⚫ ⚫║   │   mztape™
│   ║ ═ ═ ║   │
│   ╚═══╝     │
└─────────────┘
```
- Nostalgic, warm, curated (mixtape metaphor)
- Differentiates from tech competitors
- Risk: Might feel dated to younger audience

**Recommendation: Option 1 (mz monogram)**
- More versatile, ages better
- Cassette metaphor works better in copy ("curated like a mixtape") than logo

---

### Color Palette

**Primary Palette:**
```
Navy:      #1A3A52 (trust, professionalism)
Cream:     #F5F1E8 (warmth, hospitality)
Copper:    #C87941 (accent, CTAs, boutique aesthetic)
Charcoal:  #2D2D2D (text, headers)
```

**Why NOT CCS colors (teal/yellow)?**
- CCS teal/yellow tied to Seattle civic identity
- mztape needs broader geographic appeal
- Hotel audience expects more upscale aesthetic
- Navy/cream/copper = boutique hospitality industry standard

**Usage:**
- Navy: Headers, navigation, buttons (secondary)
- Cream: Backgrounds, cards
- Copper: CTAs, links, highlights
- Charcoal: Body text

---

### Typography

**Headings:**
```
Font: Playfair Display (serif)
Style: Bold
Usage: H1, H2 (editorial, upscale feel)
```

**Body:**
```
Font: Inter (sans-serif)
Style: Regular (400), Medium (500)
Usage: Body text, UI elements (readable, modern)
```

**Accent:**
```
Font: Inter (sans-serif)
Style: SemiBold (600)
Usage: Buttons, labels, CTAs
```

**Why:**
- Playfair (serif headings) = boutique, editorial, upscale
- Inter (sans body) = clean, readable, modern
- Contrast between serif/sans = professional but approachable

---

### Tone of Voice

**Overall Tone:** Professional but warm, like a boutique hotel concierge

**Do:**
- "Give every guest the VIP treatment"
- "Your favorite spots"
- "Authentic local recommendations"
- "Concierge-quality"
- "Hidden gems"

**Don't:**
- "Synergize guest engagement touchpoints" (too corporate)
- "Disrupt the hospitality industry" (too Silicon Valley)
- "AI-powered recommendations" (unless it's true—and even then, lead with human curation)

**Voice Attributes:**
1. **Knowledgeable:** We understand hotel operations intimately
2. **Respectful:** We respect your time and expertise
3. **Practical:** We focus on ROI, not hype
4. **Warm:** We love hospitality, not just tech

---

### Visual Style

**Photography:**
- Authentic hotel environments (not stock photos)
- Front desk staff interacting with guests
- Mobile device showing recommendations (in natural context)
- Local businesses (restaurants, coffee shops) with warm lighting

**Avoid:**
- Corporate stock photos (handshakes, suits)
- Generic hotel chains (Marriott-style lobbies)
- Tech startup aesthetic (MacBooks, standing desks, neon signs)

**Illustration Style (if used):**
- Line drawings, minimal, warm
- Hand-drawn feel (not geometric/corporate)
- Use sparingly—prioritize real photos

---

## Technical Requirements

### Domain & Hosting

**Domain:**
- Primary: **mztape.com** (register if not already owned)
- Redirect: **qrcards.com** → mztape.com (if applicable)

**Hosting:**
- Use existing QRCards infrastructure (same backend)
- Separate frontend for mztape.com (distinct branding)
- Option: Subdomain approach (mztape.qrcards.com) if domain not available

**SSL Certificate:**
- Required (HTTPS for all pages)

---

### Analytics

**Google Analytics 4:**
- Track: Page views, demo requests, trial signups, pricing page visits
- Goals: Demo request submitted, trial started, pricing viewed

**Hotjar (Optional):**
- Heatmaps for homepage, pricing page
- Session recordings to identify UX issues
- User feedback polls ("What's preventing you from starting a trial?")

---

### Demo Request Form

**Backend:**
- Form submission → Email notification to ivan@mztape.com
- Store submissions in database (for CRM/follow-up)
- Auto-reply email to prospect: "Thanks for your interest! We'll be in touch within 24 hours."

**Email Template (Auto-Reply):**

   - Hotel name, number of rooms
   - Shipping address (for 100 cards)
3. Email confirmation: "Check your email to verify account"
4. User logs in → mztape admin dashboard

3. Sales sends trial invite: "Here's your trial account link..."
4. Same flow as Option A, but with personal onboarding call scheduled
```

**Recommendation: Offer both options**
