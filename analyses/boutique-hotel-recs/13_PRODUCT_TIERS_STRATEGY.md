# Product Tiers Strategy: Laminated Sheet → Deck → Personalized

**Key Insights:**
1. **Penguin card** (analytics card) = lead magnet + engagement tracking
2. **Some hotels just want laminated sheet** = simpler entry point, still valuable
3. **Upsell path:** Static sheet → Deck (pre-configured) → Personalized (custom per guest)

## The Penguin Card: Analytics + Lead Capture

### What It Is

**Special card in every demo deck:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│    [Penguin illustration]   │
│                             │
│    Staff Analytics Card     │
│                             │
│         [QR Code]           │
│                             │
│    Scan to see your stats   │
│    and unlock pro features  │
│                             │
│    Card: 🐧                 │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why Penguin (Not Joker)?**
- Joker = wild card, chaos, unpredictable
- Penguin = friendly, professional, distinctive
- "Black tie" aesthetic (hotel staff vibe)
- Memorable ("Did you scan the penguin card?")

### What Happens When Scanned

### Why This Works

**1. Lead Magnet (Email Capture)**
```
Hotel staff wants weekly stats → Enters email → You have confirmed contact
```

**2. Engagement Tracking**
```
Penguin card scanned = Hotel is actively using system
Penguin card NOT scanned = Hotel may need follow-up
```

**3. Upsell Opportunity**
```
Staff sees ROI ("You saved 18.9 hours this week = $378")
→ Upgrade CTA is right there
```

**4. Reduces Support Load**
```
Instead of: "How do I see my stats?" → Email support
Now: "Scan the penguin card" → Self-service
```

## Product Tiers: Simple to Complex

**What It Is:**
```
Single laminated sheet (8.5" x 11" or 11" x 17")

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Use Case:**
- Hotel prints 100 copies of same sheet
- Leaves in guest rooms (on desk or in welcome folder)
- OR hands out at check-in
- Every guest gets same recommendations (not personalized)

**Pricing:**
- **Free tier:** Hotel uses demo (mztape™ branding, time/usage limited)
- **Basic tier: $39/month** (hotel branding, unlimited scans, download PDF)

---

### Tier 2: Deck (Pre-Configured)

**What It Is:**
```
52 unique cards (playing card style)
Each card = different category/combination:
- A♥ = 3 romantic dinner spots
- 2♥ = 3 romantic breakfast spots
- A♠ = 3 adventurous dinner spots
- 6♣ = 5 family-friendly shopping spots
... etc
```

**Use Case:**
- Hotel prints deck (52 cards × 10 copies = 520 cards)
- Staff picks card based on guest type:
  - Couple → A♥ (romantic dinner)
  - Family → 6♣ (family shopping)
  - Business traveler → 3♠ (coffee + coworking)
- Guest gets card relevant to their needs (semi-personalized)
- Staff doesn't customize online (just picks right card from deck)

**Pricing:**
- **Starter tier: $79/month** (includes deck configuration, unlimited scans)

---

### Tier 3: Personalized (Custom per Guest)

**What It Is:**
```
Same 52-card deck, but staff customizes online before handing card:

1. Staff picks card (e.g., 10♦ = luxury full day itinerary)
2. Staff logs into mztape admin
3. Staff adds/removes specific spots for this guest:
   - Remove: Pike Place Market (guest already went)
   - Add: New restaurant that just opened
4. Staff hands card (pre-printed) → Guest scans → Sees custom page
```

**Use Case:**
- Hotel wants maximum personalization
- Staff has time to customize (3-5 min per guest vs 30 sec)
- High-touch service (luxury boutique hotels)

**Pricing:**
- **Professional tier: $129/month** (includes deck + customization UI)

---

---

### Month 1: Upgrade to Basic ($39/month)

**Hotel decides:**
```
"I like this, but I don't need 52 different cards.
 Can I just have one sheet with my top recommendations?"
```

**You say:**
```
"Yes! We have a Basic plan—one laminated sheet, $39/month.

```

**Hotel upgrades:**

---

### Month 3: Upsell to Starter ($79/month)

**Trigger: Hotel scans 500+ times**

**Email:**
```
Subject: Your guests love your recommendations! Ready to get more personal?

Hi [Hotel Name],

You've had 500+ scans in the last 3 months—guests are clearly using
your recommendations!

Here's what we noticed:
• Couples scan most often (6:00-8:00 PM, looking for dinner)
• Families scan in the morning (8:00-10:00 AM, looking for breakfast)
• Solo travelers scan midday (looking for coffee shops)

Right now, everyone gets the same sheet. What if you could hand couples
a card with romantic spots, and families a card with kid-friendly spots?

That's what our Starter plan does: 52 pre-configured cards, pick the
one that fits your guest. No online customization needed—just pick
the right card from the deck (takes 30 seconds).

Upgrade to Starter ($79/month) and we'll ship you a free demo deck
to test it out.

[Upgrade to Starter]

Best,
Ivan

### Month 6: Upsell to Professional ($129/month)

**Trigger: Hotel handed out 200+ cards (from Starter deck)**

**Email:**
```
Subject: You've handed out 200+ cards! Want to customize on-the-fly?

Hi [Hotel Name],

You're a power user! You've handed out 200+ cards in the last 3 months.

Your most popular cards:
• A♥ (romantic dinner) - 58 times
• 10♦ (luxury full day) - 42 times
• 6♣ (family shopping) - 36 times

These pre-configured cards are working great. But sometimes you want
to customize:
• VIP guest → Add that new restaurant that just opened
• Repeat guest → Remove spots they've already visited
• Special request → "We're vegetarian, any recommendations?"

That's what Professional plan does: Start with pre-configured card,
customize online in 2-3 minutes, hand to guest.

Upgrade to Professional ($129/month) and get:
✓ Online customization (add/remove spots per card)
✓ Seasonal deck generator (refresh designs quarterly)
✓ Advanced analytics (see which guests scanned, when)

[Upgrade to Professional]

## Demo Deck Strategy by Tier

### Option A: Ship Same Demo Deck to All Prospects

**Demo deck includes:**
- 52 cards (full deck)
- Penguin card (staff analytics)
- Quick-start guide:
  ```
  "Try it three ways:
  1. Basic: Print same card 100 times (all guests get same recs)
  2. Starter: Hand different cards to different guests (pick from deck)
  3. Professional: Customize online before handing card

  After 30 days, choose the plan that fits your workflow."
  ```

**Pros:**
- One demo fulfillment process (same deck for everyone)
- Hotel self-selects tier based on usage

**Cons:**
- May be overkill for budget hotels (they see 52 cards, think "too complex")

---

### Option B: Ship Different Demo Formats by Prospect Type

**For budget hotels (suspected Basic tier):**
- Ship laminated sheet demo (not deck)
- Include penguin QR code on sheet for analytics

**For boutique hotels (suspected Starter tier):**
- Ship 52-card deck
- Include penguin card

**For luxury hotels (suspected Professional tier):**
- Ship 52-card deck + customization tutorial
- Schedule onboarding call to show online customization

**Pros:**
- Right demo for right prospect (no confusion)

**Cons:**
- More complex fulfillment (track which demo to send)

---

**Recommendation: Option A** (ship full deck to everyone, let them self-select tier)

---

## Penguin Card: Advanced Features (Future)

### Feature 1: QR Code Directly on Penguin Card

**Instead of: Hotel scans penguin → Enters email on page**

**New: Penguin card has unique QR per hotel**
```
When hotel scans:
• System knows which hotel it is (based on unique QR)
• Auto-fills email if already subscribed
• Shows stats instantly (no login required)
```

---

### Feature 2: Push Notifications

**Hotel downloads mztape staff app:**
```
Penguin card becomes less necessary:
• App shows live stats (push notifications when guest scans)
• "New scan: Guest just scanned A♥ at 7:15 PM"
• Weekly stats delivered via app (not just email)
```

---

### Feature 3: Multiple Penguin Cards (Role-Based)

**Different penguin cards for different staff roles:**

**Card 1: Manager Penguin (full stats)**
```
Scans to see:
• Revenue impact (which recommendations drive most engagement)
• Staff usage (which front desk staff using system most)
• Upgrade opportunities ("Add 10 more recommendations for $20/month")
```

**Card 2: Front Desk Penguin (quick stats)**
```
Scans to see:
• Today's scans (real-time)
• Top 3 recommendations today
• Quick tip ("Guest asked for vegetarian? Try A♣ card")
```

---

## Summary: Product Tier Strategy

### Three Tiers, One Upsell Path:

**Basic ($39/month):** Laminated sheet → Print once, use forever
- For budget hotels, "set it and forget it"

**Starter ($79/month):** 52-card deck → Pick card based on guest type
- For boutique hotels, semi-personalized without online work

**Professional ($129/month):** 52-card deck + customization → Edit online per guest
- For luxury boutique hotels, full personalization

---

### Penguin Card = Staff Analytics + Lead Magnet

**Purpose:**
1. Show stats (scan count, popular recs, time saved)
2. Capture email (weekly stats report subscription)
3. Upsell prompt (ready to upgrade? See pricing)
4. Engagement tracking (hotel scanned penguin = actively using)

**Where it lives:**
- Demo deck: Included (53rd card)
- Basic tier: Small QR on laminated sheet
- Starter tier: 53rd card in deck
- Professional tier: 53rd card in deck

---

### Next Steps:

1. **Design penguin card** (front: friendly penguin illustration + "Staff Analytics")
2. **Build stats page** (what staff sees when they scan)
3. **Email capture flow** (subscribe to weekly stats)
4. **Test with 5 hotels** (does penguin card get scanned? Does email capture work?)

---

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Define product tiers (laminated sheet → deck → personalized) + penguin card analytics strategy
**Key Insight:** Not every hotel needs 52 cards—some just want laminated sheet. Upsell to deck when engagement warrants it.
