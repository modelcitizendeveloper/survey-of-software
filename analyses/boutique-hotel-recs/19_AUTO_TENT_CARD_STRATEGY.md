# Auto-Sending Tent Cards to Recommended Businesses

**The Idea:** When Hotel A adds Giuseppe's to their recommendations, mztape automatically sends Giuseppe's a tent card (pre-configured for tracking).

**Question:** Any issues?

---

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Unsolicited Mail (Spam Risk)

**Problem:**
```
Giuseppe's owner opens mail:
"What is mztape? I didn't order this. Why are they sending me tent cards?"

→ Feels like spam
→ Card goes in trash
→ Wasted $3 + shipping
```

**Mitigation:**
```
Include cover letter:
"Good news! Hotel A is now recommending Giuseppe's to their guests.
 We're the platform they use (mztape).

 This tent card helps you track how many hotel guests visit.
 Just place it on tables—when guests scan, you'll see which hotels
 send you the most customers.

 Questions? Call Hotel A at [phone] or us at [support email]"
```

**Better: Email first, mail second**
```
1. Hotel adds Giuseppe's to recommendations
2. mztape emails Giuseppe's: "Hotel A is recommending you! Want a free tent card for tracking?"
3. If Giuseppe's clicks "Yes, send card" → Mail tent card
4. If Giuseppe's ignores email → Don't send card (save $3)
```

---

### Issue 2: Business Didn't Consent to Be Recommended

**Problem:**
```
Hotel A adds Giuseppe's without asking Giuseppe's permission
→ Giuseppe's might not want to be associated with Hotel A
→ What if Hotel A has bad reputation?
→ What if Giuseppe's is at capacity and doesn't want more traffic?
```

**Legal question:**
```
Can Hotel A recommend Giuseppe's without permission?

Answer: Probably yes (First Amendment—hotels can recommend public businesses)

But: Giuseppe's might not appreciate it
```

**Mitigation:**
```
Cover letter includes:
"If you'd prefer NOT to be recommended by Hotel A, let us know.
 We'll remove you from their list."

→ Opt-out option (not opt-in)
→ Most businesses won't opt out (free marketing)
```

---

### Issue 3: Duplicate Cards (Multiple Hotels Recommend Same Business)

**Problem:**
```
Hotel A recommends Giuseppe's → Tent card sent
Hotel B recommends Giuseppe's → Another tent card sent
Hotel C recommends Giuseppe's → Another tent card sent

Giuseppe's receives 3 identical tent cards in 3 weeks
→ Annoying, wasteful
```

**Mitigation Option A: Send once per business (ever)**
```
First time ANY hotel recommends Giuseppe's:
→ Send tent card

Subsequent hotels that recommend Giuseppe's:
→ Don't send another card (Giuseppe's already has one)

Cover letter:
"You've been recommended by 3 hotels: Hotel A, Hotel B, Hotel C.
 Here's one tent card that tracks all of them."
```

**Mitigation Option B: Send updated card when new hotel adds them**
```
Hotel A recommends Giuseppe's:
→ Send tent card: "Recommended by Hotel A"

Hotel B also recommends Giuseppe's:
→ Send updated card: "Recommended by Hotel A, Hotel B"

Hotel C also recommends Giuseppe's:
→ Send updated card: "Recommended by Hotel A, Hotel B, Hotel C"

Giuseppe's always has most current card with all hotel logos
```

**Recommendation: Option A** (send once, update digitally)
- One physical card sent
- QR code dynamically shows all hotels that recommend them
- No duplicate mailings

---

### Issue 4: Cost at Scale

**Problem:**
```
100 hotels × 20 businesses each = 2,000 unique business recommendations
→ 2,000 tent cards to mail
→ 2,000 × $3 = $6,000 cost
```

**But: Many overlaps (Giuseppe's recommended by 3 hotels)**
```
Actual unique businesses: ~500 (not 2,000)
→ 500 tent cards × $3 = $1,500
```

**Still expensive at scale.**

**Mitigation: Email-first approach**
```
1. Email business: "Want a free tent card?"
2. Only send if they respond "Yes"
3. Response rate: 30-50%
4. 500 businesses × 40% response = 200 tent cards
5. 200 × $3 = $600 (manageable)
```

---

### Issue 5: Business Doesn't Understand / Doesn't Use Card

**Problem:**
```
Giuseppe's receives tent card
→ Doesn't understand what to do with it
→ Card sits in back office, never placed on tables
→ Zero tracking data
→ Wasted $3
```

**Mitigation:**
```
Cover letter includes:
• Photo of card on restaurant table (visual example)
• "Place this on your tables so guests can scan"
• QR code to 2-minute explainer video
• Phone number: "Questions? Call us at [number]"
```

**Better: Include in email/mail**
```
"Here's what other restaurants do with their tent card:
 [Photo of card on table]
 [Testimonial: 'We get 40 hotel guests/month now!']"
```

---

### Issue 6: Business Relationship Unclear

**Problem:**
```
Giuseppe's thinks:
"Did Hotel A tell me they're recommending us? Should I call them?
 Do they want something from me (commission, discount, etc.)?"
```

**Mitigation:**
```
Cover letter clarifies:
"Hotel A chose to recommend you (no payment required from you).
 You don't owe Hotel A anything.

 This tent card is optional—it just helps you see how many guests
 they're sending you.

 If you want to thank Hotel A (send them a gift card, offer discount),
 that's up to you—but it's not required."
```

---

### Issue 7: Liability / Brand Association

**Problem:**
```
Tent card says: "Recommended by Hotel A"
→ What if Hotel A has bad reputation?
→ What if Hotel A goes out of business?
→ Giuseppe's doesn't want to be associated
```

**Mitigation:**
```
Tent card says: "Thanks for visiting!"
→ Neutral (no hotel logos on front)

QR code scan shows: "You were recommended by Hotel A"
→ Digital attribution (not printed on card)

If Hotel A closes or Giuseppe's wants to remove association:
→ Update digitally (no need to reprint cards)
```

---

## When Auto-Sending Works

### Scenario A: Hotel-Dense Neighborhoods

**Example: Downtown Seattle**
```
10 hotels within 0.5 mi radius
All recommend Giuseppe's (walkable, popular spot)
→ Giuseppe's gets 1 tent card, tracks all 10 hotels
→ High value for Giuseppe's (40+ visits/month from hotels)
→ Likely to use card (meaningful data)
```

**Auto-send makes sense:**
- Giuseppe's will appreciate data
- High adoption rate (they see value)

---

### Scenario B: Single Hotel Recommends Many Businesses

**Example: Hotel A recommends 20 businesses**
```
Hotel A adds 20 spots to recommendation sheet
→ mztape auto-sends 20 tent cards
→ 5 businesses place card on tables (25% adoption)
→ 15 businesses ignore (75% waste)

Cost: 20 × $3 = $60
Value: 5 businesses × ~$25/month analytics subscription = $125/month
ROI: Positive if businesses convert to paid
```

**Auto-send is risky:**
- 75% waste rate
- Better to email first, mail only if interested

---

## Recommended Approach: Email First, Mail Second

### Step 1: Hotel Adds Business to Recommendations

```
Hotel A adds Giuseppe's to their recommendation sheet
→ mztape saves recommendation
→ Giuseppe's doesn't receive anything yet
```

---

### Step 2: Email Business (Soft Opt-In)

**Email to Giuseppe's:**
```
Subject: Good news—Hotel A is now recommending you!

Hi Giuseppe's,

Hotel A just added you to their guest recommendation list.
That means ~360 guests/month will see your restaurant when they
check in.

Want to track how many guests visit? We'll send you a free tent
card to place on your tables. When guests scan it, you'll see:
• How many guests came from Hotel A
• Peak times (when hotel guests visit)
• Which hotels send you the most customers

[Yes, send me a tent card] [No thanks, I'm good]

Best,
mztape team
```

---

### Step 3: Only Send Card if Business Responds "Yes"

**If Giuseppe's clicks "Yes, send card":**
```
→ Mail tent card + cover letter
→ Cost: $3 + shipping = ~$5-8
→ High adoption rate (they asked for it)
```

**If Giuseppe's ignores email:**
```
→ Don't send card
→ Cost: $0
→ Hotel A's recommendations still work (Giuseppe's just doesn't get tracking data)
```

---

### Step 4: Follow-Up After Card Delivered

**Email 1 week after mailing:**
```
Subject: Did you receive your tent card?

Hi Giuseppe's,

Your tent card should have arrived by now. Here's how to use it:

1. Place card on tables (see photo)
2. When guests scan, you'll see dashboard here: [link]
3. Track which hotels send you the most customers

## Metrics to Track

### Adoption Rate (% of businesses that use card)

**Goal: 60%+ adoption**

```
100 tent cards sent
→ 60 placed on tables (guests scan)
→ 40 never placed (sitting in back office)

Adoption rate: 60%
```

**If adoption <40%:**
- Cover letter unclear? (improve instructions)
- Card design confusing? (redesign)
- Businesses don't see value? (better email pitch)

---

### Response Rate (Email opt-in)

**Goal: 30-50% click "Yes, send card"**

```
100 businesses emailed
→ 40 click "Yes, send me a tent card"
→ 60 ignore email

Response rate: 40%
```

**If response rate <20%:**
- Email subject line unclear? (A/B test)
- Value prop weak? ("Free tracking" doesn't resonate)
- Email goes to spam? (check deliverability)

---

### Cost Per Activated Business

**Goal: <$10 per business that actually uses card**

```
100 businesses emailed (cost: $0 - free emails)
→ 40 respond "Yes" (cost: 40 × $6 = $240 to mail cards)
→ 24 place card on tables (60% adoption of those who received card)

Cost per activated: $240 / 24 = $10
```

**If cost >$15:**
- Too much waste (lower response rate or adoption)
- Consider phone follow-up instead of auto-mail

---

## Alternative: Hotel Hand-Delivers Tent Cards

### The Manual Approach

**Instead of mztape auto-sending:**

```
1. Hotel A adds Giuseppe's to recommendations
2. mztape sends Hotel A a tent card for Giuseppe's
3. Hotel A walks tent card to Giuseppe's (0.3 mi away)
4. Hotel A: "Hey, we're recommending you to our guests. Here's a tent card to track visits."
5. Giuseppe's: "Oh cool, thanks!"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Personal touch (hotel<>business relationship)
- ✅ Giuseppe's more likely to use card (hand-delivered by partner)
- ✅ Hotel sees if Giuseppe's is receptive (relationship building)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires hotel effort (10 min walk per business × 20 businesses = 3 hours)
- ❌ Not scalable (boutique hotel won't do this for all 20 spots)

**When it works:**
- Hotel has <5 core recommendations (top favorites)
- Hotel wants tight relationship with businesses
- Hotel is 1-2 blocks from businesses (easy walk)

---

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Tier 1: Auto-Email All Businesses

```
Hotel adds business → mztape emails business
→ "Want a free tent card for tracking?"
→ 30-50% opt in
```

**Cost: $0 (emails are free)**

---

### Tier 2: Mail to Opt-Ins

```
Business clicks "Yes, send card"
→ mztape mails tent card + cover letter
→ 60% adoption rate (place card on tables)
```

**Cost: $5-8 per card**

---

### Tier 3: Hotel Hand-Delivers (Optional)

```
For hotel's TOP 5 favorites:
→ mztape prints 5 tent cards, ships to hotel
→ Hotel walks cards to businesses (relationship building)
→ 90%+ adoption (personal delivery)
```

**Cost: $3 per card + $10 shipping to hotel = $25 total**

---

## Summary: Auto-Sending Issues & Solutions

### Issues:

1. **Unsolicited mail** → Email first, mail only if opt-in
2. **Business didn't consent** → Include opt-out option in email
3. **Duplicate cards** → Send once per business (not once per hotel)
4. **Cost at scale** → Email first (free), mail second ($5-8 only to responders)
5. **Low adoption** → Follow-up email with instructions + video
6. **Unclear relationship** → Cover letter clarifies "no payment required"
7. **Brand liability** → Neutral card design (attribution digital, not printed)

---

### Recommended Approach:

```
Hotel adds business
  ↓
Email business: "Want free tent card?"
  ↓
  ├─ Yes (30-50%) → Mail card → 60% adoption
  └─ No (50-70%) → Don't send (save $6)

Cost per activated business: $10
Adoption rate: 60%
ROI: Positive if businesses later pay for analytics
```

---

### Key Principle:

**Opt-in, not opt-out.**

Don't auto-send physical mail (spam risk).
Email first (free, low friction).
Mail only if business wants it (high adoption).
