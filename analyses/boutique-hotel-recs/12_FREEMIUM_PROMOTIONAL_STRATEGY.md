# Freemium Promotional Strategy: Free Branded Deck + Local Print Partners

**Core Insight:** Send hotels a working deck with mztape branding → Let them use it free (time/usage limited) → Upgrade to customize and scale

**Key Decision:** You don't print/ship at scale. You partner with local print shops (FedEx Office, etc.) who already know the specs.

---

## The Promotional Model

### Step 1: Lead Capture

**Hotel visits mztape.com/hotels:**
```
Hero CTA:
[Get Your Free Demo Deck]

Form:
- Hotel name
- Contact name, email
- Hotel address (for shipping demo deck)
- Number of rooms

Submit → Triggers demo deck fulfillment
```

---

### Step 2: You Ship Free Demo Deck (One-Time, Small Scale)

**What They Receive:**
```
Package contains:
├── 52 pre-printed QR cards (playing card style)
│   ├── mztape™ branding (your brand, not theirs)
│   ├── Generic messaging: "Scan for local recommendations"
│   └── Each card links to working demo page
│
├── Quick-start card
│   ├── "Welcome to mztape! Here's how to use your demo deck..."
│   ├── Login credentials for demo admin panel
│   ├── "Call your local FedEx Office at [phone] to print more"
│   └── QR code → mztape.com/setup video
│
└── Upgrade card
    ├── "Want to customize with your hotel branding?"
    ├── "Ready to print unlimited decks?"
    ├── QR code → mztape.com/pricing
```

---

### Step 3: Demo Deck Experience (Free Tier)

**What's Included (Free):**
```
✓ 52 working QR cards (mztape branding)
✓ Admin panel access (assign cards to guests, add recommendations)
✓ Mobile-optimized guest pages
✓ Basic analytics (scans, popular recommendations)
✓ Time-limited: 30 days OR usage-limited: 100 scans
✓ mztape branding on guest pages (not removable)
```

**What's NOT Included:**
```
✗ Custom branding (cards show mztape™ logo, not hotel logo)
✗ White-label guest pages (shows "Powered by mztape™" footer)
✗ Unlimited scans (capped at 100 scans)
✗ PDF download (can't print more cards)
✗ Seasonal decks, advanced analytics, etc.
```

---

### Step 4: Upgrade Prompt (When Limits Hit)

**Scenario A: Time limit expires (30 days)**
```
Email on Day 28:
Subject: Your mztape demo ends in 2 days

Hi [Hotel Name],

Your demo deck has been active for 28 days! Here's what we saw:
• 87 guests scanned cards
• 312 total scans (avg 3.6 per guest)

Ready to keep using mztape?

Option 1: Upgrade to Starter Plan ($79/month)

---

**Scenario B: Usage limit reached (100 scans)**
```
Email when 90 scans reached:
Subject: You've used 90% of your free scans!

Hi [Hotel Name],

Great news—your guests love the mztape cards! You've hit 90/100 free scans.

Once you reach 100 scans, cards will stop working until you upgrade.

---

### Step 5: Upgrade Flow

**Hotel clicks "Upgrade Now":**
```
1. Choose plan (Starter $79, Professional $129, Premium $229)
2. Enter payment info (credit card)
3. Customize branding:
   - Upload logo
   - Choose colors
   - Preview guest page
4. Download PDF:
   - "Your custom deck is ready! Download PDF and print locally."
   - Print partner links:
     • FedEx Office near you: [map link]
     • Vistaprint (online, ships in 3 days)
     • Moo (premium, ships in 5 days)
5. Done! All existing cards now show custom branding (token URLs stay same)
```

---

## Why This Model Works

### For You (mztape):

**1. Low CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
```
Demo deck cost:
- Print 52 cards: $5-10 (bulk printing, mztape branding = reusable template)
- Shipping: $5-10
- Total CAC: $10-20

Customer LTV:
- $79/month × 12 months = $948 Year 1
- $79/month × 24 months = $1,896 Year 2
- ROI: 47x-189x
```

**2. Product-Led Growth**
```
Hotel uses demo deck → Guests scan → Guests love it → Hotel wants to keep it
= Built-in demand generation (demo deck = trial)
```

**3. Viral Potential**
```
Scenario:
- Hotel A gets demo deck
- Hotel B owner stays at Hotel A → Sees QR card
- Hotel B owner scans → Sees "Powered by mztape™"
- Hotel B owner visits mztape.com → Requests demo deck
```

**4. Time/Usage Limits = Urgency**
```
"You have 10 scans left before demo expires"
= Creates urgency to upgrade (don't want to lose momentum)
```

---

### For Hotel:

**1. Zero-Risk Trial**
```
Hotel thinks:
"Free deck arrives → I test with real guests → If it works, I upgrade.
 If it doesn't work, I'm out nothing."
```

**2. Proof of Concept**
```
Hotel doesn't have to imagine ROI—they see actual scans:
"87 guests scanned in 30 days = 2.9 scans/day
 If I upgrade, I save 2.9 × 27 min/day = 78 min/day = 40 hours/month
 = $800/month in staff time (at $20/hr)

 ROI: $800 savings - $79 cost = $721/month net benefit"
```

**3. Low Commitment**
```
Not buying annual contract—just $79/month subscription.
Can cancel anytime.
```

---

## Local Print Partner Strategy

### Why Partner with FedEx Office (or similar)?

**Problem:**
```
Hotel wants to print more cards, but:
- "Where do I print?"
- "What paper stock?"
- "What print settings?"
- "How much does it cost?"
```

**Solution:**
```
"Call your local FedEx Office—they already know the specs."
```

---

### The Partnership Deal

**You approach FedEx Office (or local print shop):**
```
Pitch:
"I run mztape, a guest recommendation platform for hotels.
 Hotels download PDFs and need to print 100-500 cards at a time.

 Can we create a 'standard order' that hotels can reference?

 Hotel calls: 'I need to print a mztape deck'
 FedEx staff: 'Got it—52 cards, business card size, 14pt cardstock,
               full color. That's $15 for 100 cards. When do you need it?'

 I'll include your store location on our 'Print Partner' page."
```

**Benefit for FedEx Office:**
- Recurring orders (hotels reprint every 1-3 months)
- Standardized specs (staff doesn't have to figure out settings each time)
- No design work (hotel provides print-ready PDF)

## Demo Deck Design (mztape Branding)

### Card Front (Generic Template):

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│    [mztape™ logo]           │

│    Local Recommendations    │
│                             │
│         [QR Code]           │
│                             │
│    Scan to discover         │
│    hidden gems nearby       │
│                             │
│    Card: A♥                 │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
- mztape™ branding (not hotel branding—this is demo)
- Generic messaging (works for any hotel)

## Sales Funnel

### Awareness → Demo Request
```
Hotel discovers mztape:
- Google search: "hotel guest recommendations"
- Conference booth: "Stop by for free demo deck"
- LinkedIn ad: "Get a free QR card deck for your hotel"
- Referral: Hotel B sees cards at Hotel A

→ Clicks "Get Free Demo Deck" on website
→ Fills form (name, hotel, address)
→ Receives email: "Your demo deck ships tomorrow!"
```

---

### Demo Deck Arrives → Trial Period
```
Day 1: Demo deck arrives
- Hotel receives 52 cards + quick-start guide
- Logs into admin panel
- Adds 10-20 local recommendations
- Starts handing cards to guests

Day 3-30: Active usage
- Guests scan cards
- Hotel monitors analytics ("87 scans so far!")
- Hotel sees which recommendations are popular

Day 28: Upgrade prompt
- Email: "Demo ends in 2 days—here's your stats"
- Shows ROI: "You saved 40 hours this month"
```

---

### Upgrade → Paid Customer
```
Hotel clicks "Upgrade Now":
1. Chooses plan ($79-229/month)
2. Enters payment info
3. Customizes branding (logo, colors)
4. Downloads custom PDF
5. Prints at local FedEx Office

Result:
- Existing cards now show custom branding (same token URLs)
- Hotel can print unlimited decks
- Usage limits removed

```

---

## Timeline & Logistics

### You (mztape) One-Time Setup:

**1. Design Generic Demo Deck (4-8 hours)**
- Create Canva template with mztape™ branding
- Export PDF (52 cards)
- Upload to printer for bulk order

**2. Order Bulk Demo Decks (500-1000 decks)**
- Find bulk printer (Vistaprint, GotPrint, or local)
- Print 500 demo decks (500 decks × 52 cards = 26,000 cards)
- Cost: ~$500-1,000 (bulk pricing)
- Storage: Store in your home/office (52 cards per deck = small box)

**3. Set Up Fulfillment Process**
- When hotel requests demo → You ship one deck ($5-10 shipping)
- Use USPS flat rate envelope (fits 52 cards, $5-8)
- Include quick-start card with login credentials

---

### Per Hotel:

**When demo request comes in:**
```
1. Hotel fills form on website
2. You receive notification: "New demo request from Hotel X"
3. You:
   a. Create admin account for Hotel X
   b. Print quick-start card with login credentials
   c. Pack demo deck (52 cards + quick-start card) in envelope
   d. Ship via USPS (2-5 days)
4. Hotel receives deck, logs in, starts using
```

**Time per demo fulfillment:** 10-15 minutes
**Cost per demo:** $10-20 (deck cost + shipping)

---

## Scaling Considerations

### When You Get 10+ Demo Requests Per Week:

**Option A: Hire Part-Time Fulfillment Help**
```
Pay someone $20/hour to:
- Pack demo decks
- Print quick-start cards
- Ship via USPS
- 10 demos/week = 2-3 hours/week = $40-60/week
```

**Option B: Use Fulfillment Service (e.g., ShipBob, ShipMonk)**
```
Send bulk decks to fulfillment center
When demo request comes in → Fulfillment center ships automatically
Cost: ~$3-5 per shipment (cheaper than doing yourself)
```

**Option C: Partner with FedEx Office for On-Demand Printing**
```
When demo request comes in:
1. mztape generates PDF for nearest FedEx Office to hotel
2. mztape pays FedEx to print + ship demo deck
3. FedEx prints, packages, ships
Cost: ~$25-30 per demo (higher, but zero work for you)
```

**Recommendation (Phase 1):** Do it yourself (10-15 min per demo)
**Recommendation (Phase 2):** Fulfillment service when >20 demos/week

---

## Summary: The Freemium Flywheel

### Why This Works:

**1. Low Friction Trial**
```
Hotel gets working product (not just a demo video)
→ Uses with real guests
→ Sees real results
→ Upgrades to keep momentum
```

**2. Product Sells Itself**
```
Hotel doesn't have to imagine ROI—they SEE it:
"87 guests scanned in 30 days = we saved 40 hours"
```

**3. Viral Loop**
```
Guest at Hotel A scans card → Sees "Powered by mztape™"
→ Guest owns Hotel B → Requests demo deck
```

**4. Time/Usage Limits = Urgency**
```
"You have 10 scans left" = pressure to upgrade
(Hotel doesn't want to lose momentum with guests)
```

**5. Local Printing = Scalability**
```
You don't print/ship at scale
→ Hotels print locally (FedEx Office)
→ You focus on software, not fulfillment
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1):

1. **Design demo deck template (mztape™ branding)**
2. **Order 100 demo decks** (test batch, ~$100-200)
3. **Set up demo request form** on website
4. **Create quick-start card** (login instructions + print partner info)

### Short-Term (Week 2-4):

5. **Ship 5-10 demo decks to beta hotels** (manual fulfillment)
6. **Gather feedback:** Does demo deck convert to paid?
7. **Iterate:** Adjust time/usage limits based on conversion rate

### Long-Term (Month 2-3):

8. **Scale up:** Order 500 demo decks for ongoing fulfillment
9. **Automate:** Integrate fulfillment service (ShipBob, ShipMonk)
10. **Partner with FedEx Office** for "standard mztape order"

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Define freemium promotional strategy with demo decks + local print partners
