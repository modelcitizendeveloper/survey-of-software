# Convention City Seattle: Repositioning Strategy

**Current Position:** DMO/Convention Center tool → "Connecting convention visitors to local businesses"

**New Position:** Keep CCS as-is (showcase), launch mztape.com for boutique hotels

---

## Strategic Decision: Dual-Brand Strategy

### Option A: Reposition CCS for Hotels ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**
- Leverage existing site/branding
- No new domain/site to build

**Cons:**
- **Wrong audience:** CCS is positioned for DMOs/convention centers (B2B2C), hotels are B2B
- **Wrong messaging:** "Convention visitors" doesn't resonate with boutique hotels
- **Dilutes focus:** Trying to serve two audiences (DMOs + hotels) weakens both messages
- **Brand confusion:** CCS = Seattle-specific (what about Portland/SF hotels?)

---

### Option B: Launch mztape.com for Hotels ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**
- **Clear positioning:** mztape = hospitality guest experience tool (broader than conventions)
- **Geographic flexibility:** mztape works anywhere (not Seattle-specific like CCS)
- **Brand hierarchy:** CCS becomes case study/showcase for mztape platform
- **Audience segmentation:** CCS = DMOs, mztape = hotels (clear target markets)

**Implementation:**
- Keep CCS site live (shows DMO/convention center use case)
- Launch mztape.com (primary brand for boutique hotels)
- CCS → "Powered by mztape" (establishes credibility)

---

## How to Use Convention City Seattle Site

### What to Keep from CCS (Reusable Assets)

**✅ Keep & Adapt:**
1. **QR Card visuals** (Page 3: Food, Drinks, Late night, Gifts, Snacks, Coffee)
   - Rebrand: "Convention City Seattle" → "[Hotel Name]"
   - Use in mztape.com marketing (show examples of cards)

2. **System Features list** (Page 4)
   - 90% applicable to hotels (just change "venue" → "hotel")
   - Copy to mztape.com "Features" page

3. **Mission/Vision language** (Page 6)
   - Adapt: "venues and neighborhoods" → "hotels and local businesses"
   - Use in mztape.com "About" page

4. **Map visual** (Page 3 bottom: Melrose Loop map)
   - Shows walkability, local recommendations
   - Use in mztape.com "How It Works" section

**❌ Don't Reuse:**
- Convention Center imagery (Page 2, 6, 8)
- "Convention visitors" language
- Seattle-specific messaging (unless targeting Seattle hotels specifically)

---

## CCS Site Updates (Minimal Changes)

### Change 1: Add mztape Footer (All Pages)

**Before:**
```
[No footer]
```

**After:**
```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Convention City Seattle is a pilot project powered by mztape™

mztape: The guest experience platform for hospitality
Personalized local recommendations for boutique hotels and venues

For hotels: mztape.com | For DMOs/venues: conventioncityseattle.com
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Why:** Cross-sell to hotel audience that finds CCS site

---

### Change 2: Add Hotel CTA (Page 7 - Partnership Opportunities)

**Add after existing "partnership opportunities" section:**

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Are you a boutique hotel or inn?

recommendations in 3 minutes instead of 30.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Why:** Capture hotel leads that land on CCS site

---

### Change 3: Update "Inquire" Link (Page 6)

**Before:**
```
Inquire>
[No clear CTA]
```

**After:**
```
Interested in Convention City Seattle for your venue?
→ Contact: ivan@mztape.com

Looking for hotel guest experience tools?
→ Visit: mztape.com
```

**Why:** Clear next steps for both audiences

---

### Change 4: Add Logo/Branding (Top Right)

**Add to header (all pages):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Convention City Seattle  │  mztape™    │
│                          │  [logo]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why:** Establish brand relationship (CCS = use case of mztape platform)

---

## CCS Site: What NOT to Change

**✅ Keep as-is:**
- Hero image (Page 1: Convention center view)
- Problem statement (Page 2: "They want local recommendations. What do we say?")
- QR card examples (Page 3)
- System features (Page 4)
- Mission/vision (Page 6)
- Location/map (Page 8)

**Why:** CCS is still valid showcase for DMO/convention center use case

---

## Messaging Evolution: DMO vs Hotel

### Current CCS Messaging (DMO-Focused)

| Element | CCS (DMO/Convention) |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Audience** | Convention centers, event organizers, DMOs |
| **Problem** | "Convention visitors ask for dining recommendations, but traditional guest services tools don't connect them with walkable neighborhood gems" |
| **Solution** | "QR Cards for Guest Services—Make it effortless for venue staff to share curated recommendations" |
| **Benefit** | "Economic vitality through guided foot traffic—Translate venue success into neighborhood economic vitality" |
| **CTA** | "Seeking partnerships with convention centers, event organizers, walkable local businesses" |

---

### New mztape Messaging (Hotel-Focused)

| Element | mztape (Boutique Hotels) |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Audience** | Boutique hotels (20-100 rooms), independent inns, small hotel chains |
| **Problem** | "Guests want personalized local recommendations, but your front desk spends 30 minutes per guest handwriting notes and printing Google Maps. It doesn't scale." |
| **Solution** | "Pre-printed QR code cards + your curated local favorites = concierge-quality recommendations in 3 minutes, not 30" |
| **Benefit** | "Save 20 hours/month of staff time while delivering the personal touch that boutique hotels are known for. Stand out from chain hotels with authentic local connections." |
| **CTA** | "Get 100 pre-printed cards free—Start your 30-day trial today" |

---

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | CCS (DMO) | mztape (Hotel) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Target Market** | DMOs, convention centers (5-10 in Seattle) | Boutique hotels (5,000+ nationwide) |
| **Business Model** | Pilot/showcase (not monetized yet) | SaaS subscription ($99-149/month) |
| **Geographic Scope** | Seattle-specific | National/international |
| **Value Prop** | Economic development (visitor → local business) | Operational efficiency + guest satisfaction |
| **Decision Maker** | DMO director, convention center GM | Hotel owner, GM, front desk manager |
| **Sales Cycle** | 6-12 months (government/partnership) | 4-8 weeks (B2B software) |
| **Pricing** | Partnership-based (TBD) | $99-149/month subscription |

**Key Insight:** CCS is B2B2C (DMO → convention visitors → local businesses), mztape is B2B (hotels → better guest experience). Different audiences, different messaging, different sites.

## Cross-Promotion Strategy

### How CCS Drives Hotel Leads

**Scenario 1: Boutique hotel GM finds CCS site via Google**
- Searches: "QR code guest recommendations"
- Finds: Convention City Seattle
- Sees: "Powered by mztape—For hotels, visit mztape.com"
- Clicks through → mztape.com/hotels

**Scenario 2: Convention center shows CCS to hotel partners**
- Convention center: "We use CCS to direct attendees to local restaurants"
- Hotel in area: "Can we use this for our hotel guests?"
- Convention center: "Yes! It's powered by mztape—contact them"

**Scenario 3: DMO shares CCS case study**
- DMO blog post: "How Seattle connects convention visitors to local businesses"
- Hotel reads post, sees QR card examples
- Footer link: "For hotels, visit mztape.com"

---

### How mztape Elevates CCS

**Credibility:**
- mztape.com: "Used by Convention City Seattle to connect 10,000+ convention visitors to local businesses"
- CCS becomes proof of concept (validated with DMO use case)

**Case Study:**
- mztape.com features CCS as case study
- "See it in action: Convention City Seattle uses mztape to guide foot traffic from Seattle Convention Center to Melrose Loop neighborhood"

**Social Proof:**

- "As seen in: [Seattle Times article about CCS]"

```

**Relationship:**
- **mztape = Product brand** (umbrella for all hospitality tools)
- **CCS = Showcase brand** (specific implementation in Seattle)
- **Analogy:** Salesforce (product) vs Salesforce for Nonprofits (vertical showcase)

---

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Keep CCS or Redirect to mztape?

**✅ Recommendation: Keep CCS as separate showcase site**

**Why:**
- CCS has value as DMO case study (different audience than hotels)
- CCS domain may have SEO value, backlinks
- Low cost to maintain (already built)
- Cross-promotion opportunity (CCS footer → mztape)

**Only redirect CCS → mztape if:**
- CCS generates zero DMO leads after 6 months
- Maintaining two sites too complex
- mztape.com becomes primary brand (CCS becomes `/seattle-case-study` page)

---

### Decision 2: Use CCS Branding (Teal + Yellow) for mztape?

**⚠️ Recommendation: Create new mztape brand identity**

**Why:**
- CCS colors (teal/yellow) tied to Seattle/neighborhood vibe
- mztape needs broader appeal (works in any city, any neighborhood)
- Hotel audience expects different aesthetic than DMO audience (more upscale, less civic)

**mztape Brand Considerations:**
- **Colors:** Neutral + warm (not teal/yellow) → Suggest navy/cream/gold or charcoal/sage/copper
- **Tone:** Professional, boutique hospitality (vs civic/economic development)
- **Logo:** Abstract (not place-specific) → "mz" monogram or tape cassette icon (nostalgia, curation)

---

### Decision 3: What Happens to "QR Cards" Name?

**✅ Recommendation: "QR Cards" becomes feature name, not brand name**

**Current:** "QR Cards for Guest Services" (product name)

**New:**
- **Brand:** mztape™ (master brand)
- **Feature:** QR Cards (one component of platform)
- **Usage:** "mztape uses pre-printed QR Cards to deliver recommendations"

**Why:** "QR Cards" is descriptive but not distinctive (generic term). mztape is unique, ownable brand.
