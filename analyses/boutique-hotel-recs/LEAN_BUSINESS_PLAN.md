# Lean Business Plan: mztape™ for guests at Boutique Hotels

## Company Name
**mztape™** (formerly Convention City Seattle / mztape.com)

## Identity
**Describe what your company is**

**mztape™ for guests** helps boutique hotels give every guest instant personalized local recommendations. It's hands-off for non-technical staff, turnkey for hotels, and frictionless for guests. 

How it works: Staff members hand guests a pre-printed card matched to their interests. Guests scan to see recommendations with photos, maps, and directions—no app needed. If guests want something specific, staff can add it to their card in under a minute and it updates automatically.

Simple set-up: Hotels receive pre-printed professional cards that give top local recommendations out of the box. Hotels can also create custom cards for any guest type (romantic couple, family, business traveler), and then personalize recommendations for each guest.

## Problem
**What is the problem your company will solve**

Boutique hotels (20-100 rooms) face a critical guest experience challenge:

1. **Time-consuming manual process**: Front desk staff spend 10-30 minutes per guest handwriting notes, printing Google Maps, or providing verbal directions - consuming 20-30 hours per month of staff time
2. **Inconsistent quality**: Different staff members give different recommendations, creating inconsistent guest experiences
3. **No personalization at scale**: Hotels can personalize for VIP guests but lack systems to personalize for all guests
4. **No tracking or learning**: Hotels don't know which recommendations guests love, which restaurants have declined in quality, or how to improve over time
5. **Competitive pressure**: Boutique hotels compete on authentic local experiences but have no tools to scale this differentiator against chains and Airbnb

**The core issue**: Hotels want to give every guest the VIP treatment but lack the time and tools to do so.

## Our solution
**Describe your solution**

mztape provides a complete recommendation platform with three key innovations:

**1. Fast Staff Workflow (3-5 minutes)**
- Staff opens web admin, selects from curated recommendation library
- System generates unique QR code card per guest
- Print or email to guest - no app installation or guest login required

**2. Three-Tier Product Strategy**
- **Basic ($39/month)**: Laminated sheet with 12-20 QR codes - print once, same recommendations for all guests
- **Starter ($79/month)**: 52-card deck (playing card style) - staff picks card based on guest type (romantic/family/business) without online customization
- **Professional ($129/month)**: 52-card deck + online customization - edit recommendations per guest for maximum personalization

**3. Guest Review Loop (Core Innovation)**
- Guests review recommended businesses during checkout conversation ("How was Giuseppe's?")
- Reviews accumulate on each card type, visible to future similar guests
- Hotel dashboard shows data-driven insights (Giuseppe's: 4.7/5 from 13 reviews = KEEP, Cara Mia: 3.2/5 = REMOVE)
- Recommendations improve over time through accumulated guest knowledge
- Creates "async micro-community" where guests help hotel curate better experiences

**Unique value**: Physical cards (tangible keepsake) + digital mobile experience + privacy-first (no guest login) + hospitality-specific workflow

## Target market
**Define your target customers**

**Primary: Boutique Hotels**
- 20-100 rooms (small enough for personalization, large enough for $100-200/month budget)
- Independent or small chains (2-5 properties)
- Located in tourist destinations (downtown urban, coastal, wine country, mountain resorts)
- Guest experience-obsessed, differentiate on authentic local knowledge
- Annual revenue: $1M-10M

**Decision Maker**: General Manager or Owner/Operator with $100-300/month discretionary budget authority

**Geographic Focus**:
- Primary: US boutique hotels (~15,000 properties)
- Addressable market: 5,000 hotels focused on personalization
- Initial target: 100 hotels Year 1, expanding to Pacific NW, then national

**Customer Personas**:
1. **"Hands-On Owner" (Sarah, 42)**: Owner of 35-room hotel, obsessed with TripAdvisor reviews, spends 2 hours/day giving recommendations
2. **"GM at Small Luxury Chain" (Michael, 38)**: Manages 4 properties, data-driven, needs consistent recommendations across locations
3. **"Reluctant Tech Adopter" (Linda, 55)**: Front desk manager, excellent at job but manual processes, skeptical of technology replacing personal touch

**Secondary Markets (Year 2-3)**: Vacation rentals (Airbnb Superhosts), event venues, tourism boards

## The competition
**Who are your competitors**

**Direct Competitors (Hospitality Platforms)**:
1. **TouchStay** ($20-100/month): Static guidebooks for vacation rentals - not personalized per guest, vacation rental-focused not hotels
2. **GuestJoy** ($99-299/month): SMS-based pre-arrival messaging - no physical cards, expensive
3. **Canary Technologies** ($300+/month): Enterprise guest management - overkill for boutique hotels, complex setup, expensive
4. **Generic QR platforms** ($15-50/month): Beaconstac, QR Code Generator PRO - not hospitality-specific, requires manual setup per guest

**Indirect Competitors (DIY Alternatives)**:
1. **Custom development** (Supabase/Firebase): $6,000 upfront + ongoing maintenance
2. **WordPress + plugins**: $1,000 setup + $25-50/month, clunky admin
3. **Airtable + Softr**: $58/month + $500 setup, generic not hospitality-optimized
4. **Manual process (status quo)**: $0 software but $400-600/month in staff time

**Our Competitive Advantages**:
- **Personalization at scale**: Unique card per guest (vs TouchStay's static guidebooks)
- **Physical + digital**: Tangible keepsake cards + mobile pages (vs GuestJoy SMS-only)
- **Pre-printed card model**: Professional quality cards ready immediately, no hotel printer needed (competitors require on-demand printing or are digital-only)
- **"Fill in the blanks" workflow**: Staff assigns recommendations to pre-printed cards in 3 minutes (vs creating from scratch)
- **Boutique pricing**: $99-149/month vs enterprise pricing $300+/month
- **No guest login**: Zero friction vs competitors requiring accounts
- **Review loop**: Data-driven curation improves over time (none of our competitors have this)
- **Time to market**: 2-4 weeks to launch (95% of infrastructure exists) vs competitors building from scratch (3-6 months)
