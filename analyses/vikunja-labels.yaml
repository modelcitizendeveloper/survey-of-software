# Shared Labels Template for Applications
#
# GTD-inspired labels that work with OODA loop (orthogonal concepts)
#
# GTD = Task workflow (Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage)
# OODA = Strategic loop (Observe → Orient → Decide → Act)
#
# Labels help GTD workflow WITHOUT interfering with OODA strategic decisions
#
# Usage:
#   1. Create applications/<app-name>/vikunja-tasks.yaml
#   2. Copy labels section below into your file
#   3. Add project + tasks specific to that application
#   4. Run: python populate_vikunja.py applications/<app-name>/vikunja-tasks.yaml
