# Survey of Software

> Systematic research on software libraries, tools, and frameworks

## About

The Survey of Software provides research-grade analysis of software libraries and tools. Like the Great Trigonometrical Survey mapped India over 70 years, we're systematically measuring the software library landscape.

### What We Cover

- Algorithm libraries (sorting, graph algorithms, compression)
- Data processing tools (JSON parsing, serialization, streaming)
- ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Infrastructure components (databases, messaging, caching)
- Development tools (testing, logging, monitoring)

### Research Methodology

Each research piece uses our **Four-Pass Discovery Framework**:

- **S1: Rapid Discovery** - Speed-focused, ecosystem-driven (5-10 min)
- **S2: Comprehensive Analysis** - Thorough, evidence-based (30-60 min)
- **S3: Need-Driven Discovery** - Requirement-focused (20 min)
- **S4: Strategic Selection** - Balanced, future-focused (15 min)
- **Explainer** - Domain fundamentals for newcomers (10 min)
