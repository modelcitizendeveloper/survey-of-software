description: |
  Research on classical Latin morphology libraries for language learning applications.
  Focus on declension/conjugation generation and parsing capabilities.

  CLTK (Classical Language Toolkit) with Stanza PROIEL package emerged as clear winner.
  26-hour implementation achieved 45% → 75-80% accuracy with clear path to 97-98%.

use_case: |
  Primary: Latin declension/conjugation quiz generation for language learning app
  - Generate all inflected forms from lemma (puella → puella, puellae, puellam...)
  - Parse Latin sentences word-by-word (identify declension, tense, case)
  - Interactive clicking exercise for reading comprehension
  - Spaced repetition quiz scheduling (feeds into 1.141)

key_findings:
  - CLTK only production-ready library for classical Latin
  - Package selection critical: PROIEL (70%) vs ITTB (45%) = 25% accuracy difference
  - Known-word database (500 words) leverages Zipf's Law for 50% coverage
  - Translation validation provides path to 97-98% accuracy
  - XPOS codes contain morphological features (declension, case, tense)

libraries_analyzed: 3
libraries:
  primary:
    - name: CLTK
      version: "1.5.0"
      verdict: winner
      accuracy: 75-80%
      reason: Only production-ready solution, Stanford-backed Stanza pipeline
  alternatives:
    - name: pyLatinam
      verdict: not_installable
      reason: Not available via pip, abandoned
    - name: PyWORDS
      verdict: wrong_tool
      reason: Dictionary lookup only, not a generator

deliverables:
  discovery_docs: 7
  root_docs: 15
  total_lines: 12000
  implementations: 30+
  cli_tool: latin-parse

key_achievements:
  - 45% → 70% accuracy via package switch (ITTB → PROIEL)
  - 70% → 75-80% accuracy via known-word database
  - Roadmap to 97-98% via translation validation
  - 26-hour implementation from research to working CLI tool
  - XPOS decoding unlocked declension/tense identification

integration_relationships:
  enables:
    - code: "1.141"
      title: Spaced Repetition Algorithms
      reason: Provides content for quiz scheduling
    - code: "1.142"
      title: Flashcard Systems
      reason: Can generate Anki decks from morphological data
  complements:
    - code: "1.033"
      title: Natural Language Processing
      reason: CLTK extends spaCy-style NLP to classical languages
    - code: "1.100"
      title: Text Processing
      reason: Morphological analysis is specialized text processing
  references:
    - code: "1.148"
      title: Morphological Analysis Libraries
      reason: Latin is one language in multi-language morphology research

strategic_value:
  - Foundation for language learning application
  - Extensible to Ancient Greek (same CLTK infrastructure)
  - Zero marginal cost (no API fees, runs on-device)
  - Academic backing ensures long-term maintenance
  - Validates Three Paths pattern (Path 1: self-hosted tools)

build_vs_adapt: adapt
rationale: |
  CLTK provides 70% solution out-of-box. Custom validation layers add remaining 30%.
  Building from scratch would take 300-500 hours vs 140 hours to adapt.

next_steps:
  - Curate 500-word known-word database (42 hours, 20 words/week)
  - Implement translation validation layer (40 hours)
  - Extend to Ancient Greek support (8 hours, reuse infrastructure)
  - Integrate with 1.141 spaced repetition algorithms

notes: |
  This research exemplifies the MPSE methodology strength: S1 identified winner in 1 hour,
  S3 unlocked XPOS decoding discovery that enabled the use case, S4 confirmed low-risk
  long-term investment. All four methodologies converged on same answer (rare!).

  The 26-hour implementation validates the research and demonstrates that academic-backed
  open-source libraries can provide production-ready solutions for specialized domains.
