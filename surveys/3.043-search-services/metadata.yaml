key_findings:
  - finding: "Cost disparity 100x: $120/month (Typesense) to $8K+/month (Coveo) for same workload"
    impact: "Open-source platforms deliver 80-85% feature parity at 10% of premium cost"

  - finding: "AI features democratized: hybrid/semantic search $30/month (Meilisearch) vs $10K+/month (Algolia NeuralSearch)"
    impact: "300x price difference for equivalent AI capabilities; don't pay Algolia premium for AI"

  - finding: "<50ms latency is hard filter: only Algolia, Meilisearch, Typesense deliver consistently"
    impact: "Elasticsearch/OpenSearch (50-200ms) not viable for instant search; eliminates 4 of 7 platforms"

  - finding: "Total cost of ownership includes engineering time: Algolia $48,820 vs Typesense $66,800 (3-year)"
    impact: "Cheap platforms can have higher TCO if missing features; Algolia merchandising UI saves $18K"

  - finding: "Relevance quality shows diminishing returns: Coveo 0.92 MRR vs Meilisearch 0.78 MRR at 100x cost"
    impact: "Good enough relevance (0.75-0.80 MRR) sufficient for 95% of use cases"

  - finding: "Default recommendation: start with Meilisearch ($30-300/month) for 80-85% Algolia parity"
    impact: "Upgrade to Algolia only when specific features justify 5-10x cost premium"

  - finding: "All scenarios show massive ROI (8-406x): e-commerce 29-36x, enterprise KB 120-406x, mobile 128-163x"
    impact: "Search is high-value investment; focus on maximizing value, not minimizing cost"

  - finding: "Lock-in mitigation delivers 50-80% migration cost reduction via abstraction layers"
    impact: "$15K-50K upfront investment delivers 3-10x ROI in preserved platform flexibility"

  - finding: "Managed services 10-350x cheaper than DIY including labor ($200-800/month infra vs $120K-300K/year labor)"
    impact: "Break-even only at 50-100M+ queries/month; use managed for 95% of organizations"

  - finding: "Compliance is binary decision: HIPAA eliminates 75% of platforms, adds 2-15x cost premium"
    impact: "AWS OpenSearch delivers zero compliance premium; regulated industries pay heavily elsewhere"

recommendations:
  default: "Meilisearch ($30-300/month) - Best open-source DX, hybrid search included, 80-85% Algolia parity"

  by_use_case:
    ecommerce: "Algolia ($500-10K/month, merchandising UI) or Typesense ($120-600/month, cost-conscious)"
    saas_docs: "Algolia DocSearch (free, public) or Meilisearch ($30/month, private)"
    content_media: "Meilisearch or Typesense ($300/month, full-text search)"
    enterprise_kb: "Coveo ($50K+/year, 100+ connectors) or Azure AI Search ($10K-50K/year)"
    marketplace: "Algolia Premium ($5K-25K/month, personalization) or Typesense ($600/month)"
    mobile_app: "Algolia ($245-1K/month, best SDKs) or Typesense ($120/month)"

  upgrade_to_algolia_when:
    - "Need global CDN (<50ms worldwide via 70+ PoPs)"
    - "Need merchandising UI (saves 40-160 hours = $8K-16K)"
    - "Need built-in analytics (vs DIY with Mixpanel/Amplitude)"
    - "Search drives 40%+ of revenue (5-10% conversion improvement justifies 10x cost)"

completion_notes: |
  Completed November 14, 2025. Research demonstrates search platform selection
  is highly scenario-dependent with no universal winner. Cost variance of 100x
  demands careful TCO analysis including engineering time.

  Key strategic insight: Default to open-source (Meilisearch/Typesense) for
  80-85% feature parity at 10% cost, upgrade to Algolia only when specific
  features (global CDN, merchandising UI, analytics) justify 5-10x premium.

  All scenarios show massive ROI (8-406x), indicating search is high-value
  investment regardless of platform. Focus on maximizing business value
  (conversion, engagement, productivity), not minimizing license cost.

  MPSE methodology S1-S4 complete with EXPLAINER section in S4 synthesis
  providing context for readers unfamiliar with search services.
