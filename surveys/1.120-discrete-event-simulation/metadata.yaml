notes: "Discrete event simulation libraries - SimPy, Mesa, salabim, Ciw, desmod. First experiment in new 1.120-129 simulation category. Application-neutral generic research."

summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of five discrete event simulation libraries for Python: SimPy (process-based, hosted on GitLab, most mature), Mesa (agent-based modeling, 3.1k GitHub stars), salabim (yieldless API, built-in animation, ~100-200 stars), Ciw (queueing networks specialist, 128 stars), and desmod (component-based, Western Digital). Research covers performance characteristics, modeling paradigms (process-based vs event-based vs agent-based), real-time vs batch simulation, statistics collection, visualization integration, and simulation-optimization coupling patterns. Key discovery: No comprehensive benchmarks exist across libraries; SimPy is industry standard but salabim offers lower learning curve with yieldless API.
