  Research on GraphQL as an open API design standard. Focus on portability
  across implementations, migration costs, and lock-in assessment.

  GraphQL Foundation (Linux Foundation) specification enables schema-first,
  client-driven API design with built-in introspection.

use_case: |
  Primary: API design portability across server implementations
  - Schema-first contract-driven development
  - Switch between Node.js, Postgres-native, Python, Go implementations
  - Federation patterns without vendor lock-in
  - Minimize proprietary extensions (Apollo Federation concerns)

key_questions:
  - How portable are GraphQL schemas across implementations?
  - What is the migration cost between implementations?
  - Which features are standard vs proprietary?
  - How does Apollo Federation create lock-in?
  - GraphQL vs REST/gRPC for portability?

implementations_to_analyze: 7
implementations:
  - Apollo Server (Node.js, most popular)
  - Hasura (Haskell, auto-generates from Postgres)
  - Postgraphic (Postgres-native)
  - GraphQL Yoga (Node.js, lightweight)
  - Hot Chocolate (.NET)
  - Strawberry (Python)
  - gqlgen (Go)
  - Juniper (Rust)

integration_relationships:
  complements:
    - code: "2.070"
      title: OpenAPI/REST
      reason: GraphQL is alternative/complement to REST for API design
    - code: "2.071"
      title: gRPC
      reason: Both are alternatives to REST, different strengths

research_priorities:
  - Schema portability across implementations
  - Migration cost analysis (switching servers)
  - Federation patterns (Apollo vs open standards)
  - Lock-in assessment (proprietary extensions)
  - GraphQL vs REST/gRPC comparison

standards_body: GraphQL Foundation (Linux Foundation)
specification_url: https://spec.graphql.org/
maturity: production
specification_version: October 2021 (living standard)

key_findings_s1:
  - GraphQL spec is highly portable (SDL 100%, queries 100%, resolvers 0%)
  - Lock-in varies 15/100 (GraphQL Yoga) to 60-70/100 (Apollo Federation)
  - Apollo Federation is major lock-in risk (proprietary directives, ELv2 license)
  - Open Federation (MIT, 2023) is emerging alternative (20-30/100 lock-in)
  - Database-first (Hasura, Postgraphile) trades portability for speed
  - Performance varies 9× (Hasura vs Apollo Server)

paused_reason: |
  S1 completed successfully with clear findings on portability and lock-in.
  Paused pending specific use case need for GraphQL research.

  S1 findings sufficient for high-level understanding:
  - GraphQL Yoga recommended for maximum portability (15/100 lock-in)
  - Avoid Apollo Federation, prefer Open Federation
  - SDL is 100% portable across implementations

resume_triggers:
  - Building GraphQL API and need implementation selection
  - Evaluating Apollo Federation vs Open Federation
  - Need detailed migration cost analysis between implementations
  - Require S3 use case scenarios (multi-service, real-time, etc.)

notes: |
  This is a Tier 2 (Open Standards) experiment, so focus is on STANDARD
  portability, not specific implementation selection. Server implementations
  are Tier 1 concerns.

  S1 COMPLETE (2.5 hours): Specification overview, 8 implementations surveyed,
  synthesis with recommendations. Key finding: Apollo Federation creates
  60-70/100 lock-in despite GraphQL spec being open (Open Federation is
  the mitigation strategy).

  S2-S4 DEFERRED: Backend compatibility testing, migration guides, use case
  scenarios, strategic analysis can be completed when specific need arises.
