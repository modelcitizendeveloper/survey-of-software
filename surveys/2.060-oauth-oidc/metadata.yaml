notes: "Second 2.XXX open standards experiment - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (IETF RFC 6749 + OpenID Foundation). Tests 2.XXX methodology with partial portability standard (flows standardized 15-30%, features proprietary 70-85%). Successfully demonstrated S1-S4 divergence pattern (95% → 65-70% → context-dependent → 75-80% confidence) vs OpenTelemetry's convergence. Key finding: Adopt for SSO capability, not portability (80-150 hr migrations vs 1-4 hrs). Completed with S1-S4 discovery (24 files), DISCOVERY_TOC, STANDARD_EXPLAINER, and comprehensive vs partial standards comparison report."
