  Research on morphological analysis libraries for multi-language support.
  Focus on Japanese (agglutinative), Russian (fusional), and Czech (fusional)
  for progressive language learning trainer (latin-train pattern).

use_case: |
  Primary: Parse raw text into morphological features for language training
  - Japanese: Parse hiragana/katakana/kanji → lemma, POS, reading
  - Russian: Parse text → lemma, POS, case, aspect, gender
  - Czech: Parse text → lemma, POS, case, number, gender
  - Output: JSONL format for japanese-train, russian-train trainers

languages:
  japanese:
    script: hiragana, katakana, kanji (3 scripts)
    morphology: agglutinative (particles, verb suffixes)
    libraries: MeCab, fugashi, SudachiPy, spaCy
    challenges: kanji readings, particle identification, verb conjugation

  russian:
    script: Cyrillic
    morphology: fusional (6 cases, perfective/imperfective aspect)
    libraries: pymorphy2, spaCy, UDPipe
    challenges: case inflection, aspect pairs, stress patterns

  czech:
    script: Latin (with diacritics)
    morphology: fusional (7 cases, complex declension)
    libraries: UDPipe, spaCy, MorphoDiTa
    challenges: 7 cases, declension patterns, diacritics

evaluation_criteria:
  - Accuracy: Correct lemma + POS + morphological features
  - Coverage: Handles full language (not just vocabulary subset)
  - Installation: pip installable, minimal binary dependencies
  - Performance: <100ms per sentence for real-time parsing
  - Documentation: Clear API, examples, active maintenance
  - Output format: Easy to convert to JSONL (latin-parse pattern)

key_questions:
  - Japanese: MeCab vs SudachiPy? (classic vs modern)
  - Russian: pymorphy2 vs spaCy? (morphology specialist vs general NLP)
  - Czech: UDPipe vs spaCy? (Universal Dependencies vs spaCy ecosystem)
  - Can we use spaCy for all three? (unified API)
  - How to handle multi-script (hiragana/katakana/kanji)?

    - code: "1.033"
      title: NLP Libraries
      reason: spaCy ecosystem evaluation
    - code: "1.140"
      title: Classical Language Libraries
      reason: latin-parse pattern to replicate
  enables:
    - code: "applications/language-learning"
      title: Language Learning Application
      reason: japanese-train, russian-train, czech-train implementations

experiments_enabled:
  - "1.950-japanese-text-parser": japanese-parse implementation (MeCab/SudachiPy + JSONL)
  - "1.951-russian-text-parser": russian-parse implementation (pymorphy2/spaCy + JSONL)
  - "1.952-czech-text-parser": czech-parse implementation (UDPipe/spaCy + JSONL)

strategic_value:
  - Extends latin-train pattern to modern languages
  - Validates progressive context-based learning for non-Latin scripts
  - Enables multi-language trainer with unified architecture
  - Critical for Japanese learning (3 scripts, complex morphology)

scope_rationale: |
  **Initial islands** (1.148 base): Japanese, Russian, Czech
  - Representative language families: Japonic, Slavic
  - High morphological complexity: agglutinative, fusional, 6-7 cases
  - Different script systems: hiragana/katakana/kanji, Cyrillic, Latin+diacritics

  **Connected islands** (not yet covered, roadmap candidates):
  - 1.148.1: Semitic languages (Arabic, Hebrew) - root+pattern morphology, RTL scripts
  - 1.148.2: Sinitic languages (Chinese, Mandarin, Cantonese) - minimal inflection, character-based
  - 1.148.3: Slavic expansion (Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, Polish, Ukrainian) - 6-7 cases, Cyrillic/Latin
  - 1.148.4: Germanic expansion (Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian) - moderate inflection
  - 1.148.5: Romance expansion (Italian, Portuguese, Romanian) - verb-heavy inflection
  - 1.148.6: Turkic languages (Turkish, Uzbek) - agglutinative, vowel harmony
  - 1.148.7: Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu) - agglutinative
  - 1.148.8: Sign languages (ASL, BSL) - visual morphology, no written script

  **Larger pattern space** (captured but not researched):
  - Isolating languages (Vietnamese, Thai) - minimal morphology
  - Polysynthetic languages (Inuktitut, Navajo) - extreme agglutination
  - Mixed systems (Korean - agglutinative + Chinese characters)

  **Hardware store philosophy**:
  - 1.148 (base) = "in stock now" (Japanese, Russian, Czech)
  - 1.148.X = "catalog entries" (Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, ASL, etc.)
  - Future researchers can consult catalog, order what they need
  - We don't need all answers now, but we map the question space

notes: |
  Unlike 1.141/1.142 (single clear winner), this research covers 3 languages
  with different library ecosystems. May need S2/S3 for per-language decisions.

  Pattern to replicate: latin-parse (CLTK + Stanza) → JSONL → latin-train
  Goal: japanese-parse, russian-parse, czech-parse with same JSONL format

  **Future extensions**: Use 1.148.X numbering for additional language families
  (Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, ASL, etc.). Each gets own research mini-project.

key_findings:
  - Japanese: SudachiPy clear winner (1.9M downloads/month, 2.7× more than fugashi)
  - Russian: pymorphy3 morphology specialist (585K downloads/month, successor to pymorphy2)
  - Czech: UDPipe best support (52K downloads/month, June 2024 improvements: 50-58% error reduction)
  - Pattern: Per-language specialists > unified general NLP for morphology-intensive tasks
  - No single winner (unlike 1.141 FSRS, 1.142 genanki) - requires 3 libraries

recommendations:
  japanese: SudachiPy (pip install SudachiPy)
  russian: pymorphy3 (pip install pymorphy3)
  czech: UDPipe (pip install ufal-udpipe)

discovery_method: S1-only
completion_notes: |
  S1 rapid discovery sufficient - clear popularity leaders per language.

  No unified solution (unlike previous research):
  - Each language has morphology specialist (SudachiPy, pymorphy3, UDPipe)
  - spaCy provides unified API but uses these specialists internally
  - Decision: Choose accuracy (per-language specialists) over API consistency

  S2/S3 not required because:
  - Clear download numbers (1.9M, 585K, 52K respectively)
  - Active maintenance (all have 2024-2025 releases)
  - Quality validated by adoption + academic backing

  Hardware store expansion:
  - Created LANGUAGE_FAMILIES_ROADMAP.md cataloging 11 language families
  - Maps question space: Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, ASL, Korean, Turkish, etc.
  - Future researchers: Consult catalog (1.148.X), research when needed
