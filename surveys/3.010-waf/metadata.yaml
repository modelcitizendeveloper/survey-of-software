# Key Findings
key_insights:
  - "Infrastructure vs application security trade-off: 5 minutes vs 5 days"
  - "Cloudflare dominates need-based analysis (won 5/6 use cases)"
  - "Strategic viability spectrum: hyperscalers (95% confidence) to acquisition risks (50%)"
  - "Lock-in varies dramatically: low (open source) to very high (cloud-native)"

convergence:
  high:
    - "Cloudflare for startups/MVP (98%+ confidence)"
    - "AWS WAF for AWS-native applications (95%+ confidence)"
  moderate:
    - "Enterprise choice varies by priority (features vs compliance vs stability)"

decision_frameworks:
  - "Infrastructure vs application security decision tree"
  - "Quick decision guide by context (8 scenarios)"
  - "Strategic decision tree (3-5 year outlook)"
