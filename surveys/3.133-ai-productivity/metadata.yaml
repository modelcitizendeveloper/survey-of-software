# Key Findings (S1-S4 Complete)
key_insights:
  S1_rapid:
    - "No open AI productivity standard - moderate lock-in (30min-4h migration)"
    - "Cost varies 7× ($0 Reclaim free to $34 Motion)"
    - "Reclaim.ai best for most people (free tier, calendar-first, $8-12/month)"
    - "Motion best for advanced users (most powerful AI, $34/month)"
    - "ROI exceptional: 5-10h/month saved = $250-500 value, 10-60× ROI"
  S2_comprehensive:
    - "AI sophistication varies 10× (Motion = constraint solver, Trevor = basic rules)"
    - "No GPT-4/Claude yet (all custom ML, LLM integration coming 2026+)"
    - "TCO ≠ subscription (Year 1 TCO = 2-5× subscription due to setup/learning costs)"
    - "Best value unchanged: Reclaim Pro ($96/year TCO = $3k-6k value = 30-60× ROI)"
  S3_need_driven:
    - "Persona matching critical (ADHD → Motion autopilot, managers → Reclaim Smart 1:1s)"
    - "Workload complexity drives choice (<10 tasks = free, 30+ tasks = Motion)"
    - "Reclaim = 70-80% use cases (versatile), Motion = 20-30% (specialized)"
    - "Trevor/Sunsama = niche (<10%, high time cost $1.5k-3k/year)"
  S4_strategic:
    - "Build vs buy threshold ~100 users (<100 = buy SaaS, >100 = consider building)"
    - "Vendor survival moderate (Reclaim 85-90%, Motion 70-80%, 5-year estimates)"
    - "Lock-in LOW-MODERATE (Reclaim 30-60min, Motion 2-4h migration)"
    - "Big Tech entry 2026-2028 (Google Calendar AI, Outlook AI free = market shift)"
    - "Market consolidation by 2030 (40-50% acquisition, 30-40% wind-down)"
