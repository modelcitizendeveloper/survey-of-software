key_findings:
  - finding: "Price variance 1,000x: $9.50/month (Bunny) to $10K+/month (Cloudinary Enterprise)"
    impact: "$2K-10K+/year cost optimization possible via targeted platform selection"

  - finding: "No universal winner - platform choice depends on use case (bandwidth, features, DX, budget)"
    impact: "ImageKit (87/100 composite) for balanced, Cloudflare R2 (85/100) for high-bandwidth >1TB"

  - finding: "Bandwidth is primary cost driver (60-80% of total) with 4-50x cost variance between platforms"
    impact: "Cloudflare R2 zero-egress delivers 75-84% cost savings for >1TB/month workloads"

  - finding: "AVIF adoption saves 40-55% bandwidth (95% browser support 2025)"
    impact: "$48K-66K/year savings for 10TB/month workload; only 4 platforms support AVIF output"

  - finding: "Performance hierarchy: 2-5x transformation speed variance (10-180ms)"
    impact: "Imgix (10-50ms) or Cloudflare (20-80ms) mandatory for performance-critical use cases"

  - finding: "Modern developer experience reduces integration time 50-70% (1-2 hours vs 3-5 hours)"
    impact: "ImageKit React hooks + Next.js loader vs Cloudinary 4-7 day learning curve"

  - finding: "Platform selection is time-phased: optimize for launch speed (ImageKit), then migrate to cost-optimized (Cloudflare R2) at Month 9-12"
    impact: "Payback in 1-2 months; don't over-optimize Month 1 ($10K-20K opportunity cost)"

  - finding: "Specialization delivers 10-680x ROI: Sirv 360° spins = +25% conversion = +$480K revenue/year"
    impact: "$49.50/month cost savings (Bunny vs Sirv) vs $480K/year revenue loss = 808x opportunity cost"

  - finding: "DIY vs managed: managed 10-350x cheaper when including labor ($73/month infrastructure vs $120K-300K/year labor)"
    impact: "Break-even only at 50-100TB+/month; use managed for 95% of organizations"

  - finding: "Vendor consolidation risk: 50-70% acquisition probability by 2030; lock-in mitigation delivers 50-80% migration cost reduction"
    impact: "Implement URL abstraction layers ($5K-20K) for 10-25x ROI in preserved migration optionality"

completion_notes: |
  Completed November 13, 2025. Natural follow-up to 3.030 CDN research (Nov 12).
  Research demonstrates image processing platform selection is highly context-dependent
  with no universal winner. Cost variance of 1,000x demands careful TCO analysis.

  Key strategic insight: Platform selection is time-phased (launch speed → cost optimization)
  and specialization delivers extreme ROI (10-680x) through business outcomes beyond
  technical metrics.

  MPSE methodology S1-S4 complete with EXPLAINER section in S4 synthesis providing
  context for readers unfamiliar with image processing services.
