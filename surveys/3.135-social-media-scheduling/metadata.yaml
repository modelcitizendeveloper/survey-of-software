notes: |
  This research focuses on solo consultants and small businesses (1-5 person teams),
  not enterprise features. Evaluation criteria prioritize AI capabilities (critical for 2025),
  integration with AI content generation tools, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use.

  **Critical Finding**: No AI content generation tool (Copy.ai, Jasper, ChatGPT) has native
  integrations with social media schedulers (Buffer, Hootsuite, Later). All automation requires
  middleware like Zapier or Make.

  Research provides a "hardware store" of options across budget ranges ($0-120/mo) with clear
  use case matching. Buffer Essentials emerges as best overall for solo consultants due to
  AI features, simplicity, and ROI.
