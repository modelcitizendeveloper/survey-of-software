summary: |
  Comprehensive research into Python JWT libraries for authentication and authorization.
  Research covers library ecosystems, security features, algorithm support, validation
  capabilities, and practical selection criteria for token-based authentication systems.
  Methodologies diverged based on priorities: popularity (PyJWT) vs security (Authlib).

key_findings:
  - "Methodology divergence: S1/S3 recommended PyJWT (popularity, simplicity), S2/S4 recommended Authlib (security, long-term viability)"
  - "Authlib: Zero CVEs - only library with clean security record, but more complex and comprehensive"
  - "PyJWT: Industry standard (5,500 stars, 56M weekly downloads), but has 3 CVEs including 1 unpatched (CVE-2025-45768)"
  - "python-jose: CRITICAL - unmaintained (2021-2025), multiple CVEs, actively being abandoned by ecosystem (FastAPI migrated away)"
  - "jwcrypto: Red Hat corporate backing, 10-year RHEL maintenance guarantee, FIPS compliance path, but verbose API"
  - "Security vs simplicity trade-off: Authlib (0 CVEs, professional maintenance) vs PyJWT (simpler API, wider ecosystem adoption)"
  - "FastAPI's migration from python-jose to PyJWT signals ecosystem shift toward PyJWT for simplicity"
  - "Authlib commercial sustainability model provides 7-day security fix SLA and long-term viability guarantees"

notes: |
  This is Tier 1 research focused on JWT libraries for Python. JWT is a critical
  authentication/authorization building block. Security is paramount - vulnerable JWT
  implementations can lead to authentication bypasses and privilege escalation attacks.
  Research integrates with 1.060 (cryptographic libraries) and 2.060 (OAuth/OIDC standards).
