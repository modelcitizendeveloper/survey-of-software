  sales pipeline tracking, and marketing automation. Research covers lightweight
  CRM (Zoho, Pipedrive), mid-market (HubSpot, Freshsales), and enterprise

  integrations, lock-in, and industry-specific fit.

# Relationships
related_experiments:

  - "3.020"  # Email Communication (marketing automation)
  - "3.090"  # Customer Support (service CRM overlap)

research_methods:
  - "Web search for platform features, pricing, market positioning"
  - "G2/Capterra ratings and user reviews"
  - "Integration ecosystem analysis (POS, email, accounting)"
  - "Lock-in analysis (data export, API access, migration complexity)"
  - "Case study application (WeRise wine bar)"

# Surprising Findings
surprising_findings:
  - finding: "Close CRM has highest G2 rating (4.6) but only 1% market share"
    implication: "Quality ≠ market dominance; calling-focused niche limits TAM"

  - finding: "Zoho Bigin at $7/month includes features Pipedrive charges $29/month for"
    implication: "Massive price disparity for similar core CRM functionality"

  - finding: "HubSpot free tier is unlimited users but locks you into ecosystem"
    implication: "Freemium is acquisition strategy, not charity; lock-in by design"

  - finding: "Salesforce total cost is 2-3x list price (consulting, apps, storage)"
    implication: "Sticker price misleading; real TCO much higher for enterprise CRM"

  - finding: "Pipedrive Essential ($14) lacks automation - most teams forced to Advanced ($29)"
    implication: "Entry pricing is marketing; real starting point is 2x advertised"

# Gaps Identified
gaps_identified:
  - gap: "Industry-specific CRM platforms not deeply analyzed"
    examples: "Construction CRM (Procore, Buildertrend), Healthcare CRM (Salesforce Health Cloud), Real Estate (Follow Up Boss)"
    mitigation: "Covered under 3.005 for restaurant CRM (Toast), recommend separate research for construction/healthcare"

  - gap: "Mid-tier calling-focused CRMs underrepresented"
    notes: "Close is only calling-focused platform analyzed; other options like Dialpad Sell, Aircall CRM exist"
    impact: "Low - Close represents category well"

  - gap: "Open source CRM options not evaluated"
    examples: "SuiteCRM, EspoCRM, Odoo CRM, Twenty CRM"
    rationale: "Focus on managed services (Tier 3); open source belongs in Tier 1"
    cross_reference: "See 1.130 for comprehensive open source CRM research (self-hosted + managed open source)"
    note: "1.130 covers deployment spectrum from pure self-hosted ($500-2K/year) to managed open source (Odoo.sh $24-100/user) - lower lock-in than proprietary SaaS"

# Key Findings
key_findings:
  lightweight_segment:
    zoho_bigin_value: "Best value - 70% of features at 41% of Pipedrive Advanced cost ($12 vs $29/user)"
    pipedrive_ux: "Best visual pipeline UX, but forces Advanced plan ($29) for automation"
    close_calling: "Best calling features (power dialer, coaching), but 3-user minimum limits small teams"
    price_disparity: "2-4x price difference for similar core CRM features across platforms"

  mid_market_segment:
    hubspot_lock_in: "Free tier is acquisition strategy, contact-based pricing grows with success"
    zoho_crm_value: "1/10th HubSpot Professional cost for comparable CRM (minus marketing)"
    marketing_premium: "HubSpot charges significant premium for marketing automation integration"

  cross_segment:
    feature_gating: "Entry pricing misleading - real features start at 2x advertised price"
    integration_ecosystem: "Pipedrive/HubSpot have 400-1,000+ integrations, Bigin/Close rely on Zapier"
    calling_gap: "Only Bigin and Close have built-in calling, others require $30+/user add-ons"

# Notes
notes: |
  This is Tier 3 research focused on PROPRIETARY SaaS CRM platform selection. CRM spans
  B2C (loyalty, marketing) and B2B (sales pipeline, deal tracking). Architecture decision
  (4.090) determines if CRM is needed; this experiment evaluates which platform if yes.

  **IMPORTANT**: This research (3.501) covers PROPRIETARY SaaS platforms (Salesforce,
  HubSpot, Pipedrive, etc.). For OPEN SOURCE alternatives, see 1.130 (Twenty, Odoo,
  SuiteCRM, EspoCRM) which covers self-hosted AND managed open source deployments.

  **Key Distinction (see 1.130 strategic analysis)**:
  - 3.501 platforms: CANNOT self-host, high lock-in ($50K-500K migration)
  - 1.130 platforms: CAN self-host, low-to-zero lock-in ($0-5K migration)
  - Managed open source (1.130): SaaS convenience WITH optionality

  Market entry points serve two customer types:
  - CFO/Executive: Strategic CRM decision ($5K framework engagement)
  - Small Business: Vendor selection ($250 consultation)

  Generic case study pattern: Wine bar with B2C + B2B hybrid needs (abstracted from
  WeRise implementation). Research is GENERIC and reusable - client-specific applications
  live in /applications/[client]/ directories (see /meta/MPSE_GENERIC_VS_APPLICATION.md).

  Research follows 3.005 POS pattern: Unified S1-S4 structure with decision tree
  segmentation in S1/recommendation.md. S2 creates segmented comparison docs.

  MPSE v3.0 Complete:
  - S1 (Rapid Discovery): 5 platform profiles + decision tree (15-20 min)
  - S2 (Comprehensive Analysis): Segmented feature matrices (lightweight, mid-market)
  - S3 (Need-Driven Scenarios): 4 generic patterns (wine bar, SaaS, agency, enterprise)
  - S4 (Strategic Viability): Lock-in analysis, pricing trajectory, platform viability (20 min)

  Total research time: ~60-75 minutes for comprehensive baseline "hardware store inventory"
