summary: |
  Open protocol for agent-to-agent communication, enabling AI agents from
  different vendors to discover, negotiate, and collaborate. Complements MCP
  (agent↔tool) with horizontal integration (agent↔agent).

key_findings:
  - "A2A = agent↔agent, MCP = agent↔tool (complementary, not competing)"
  - "Task-based model with lifecycle (submitted→working→completed)"
  - "Agent Cards for capability discovery (/.well-known/agent.json)"
  - "JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S), with SSE streaming and webhook push"
  - "150+ organizations adopted, Linux Foundation governance"
  - "Python SDK: pip install a2a-sdk"

core_concepts:
  agent_cards: "JSON metadata describing agent capabilities, published at well-known URL"
  tasks: "Stateful work units with lifecycle (submitted, working, completed, failed)"
  messages: "Multi-turn conversations with role-based (user/agent) messages"
  parts: "Modality-independent content (TextPart, FilePart, DataPart)"
  artifacts: "Deliverables from completed tasks"

protocol:
  transport: "HTTP(S) with TLS 1.3+"
  payload: "JSON-RPC 2.0"
  streaming: "Server-Sent Events (SSE)"
  push: "Webhook notifications"
  bindings: ["JSON-RPC", "gRPC", "REST"]
