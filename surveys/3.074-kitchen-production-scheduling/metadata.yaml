notes: |
  This research focuses on COMMERCIAL production scheduling platforms (Tier 3 SaaS).

  Algorithmic approaches (constraint solvers, simulation) deferred to:
  - 1.096 Scheduling Libraries (OR-Tools, PuLP, constraint programming)
  - 1.120 Discrete Event Simulation (SimPy for kitchen workflow)

  Research maintains "hardware store" approach:
  - Generic commercial kitchen use cases
  - Platform comparison across bakery, catering, meal prep
  - No personal examples (Thanksgiving baking = out of scope)

  Open source (Odoo, ERPNext) included in platform landscape but NOT primary focus.
  Open source viability analysis deferred to 1.xxx algorithmic research.

  Integration overlap:
  - Heavy overlap with 3.070 inventory (ingredient availability)
  - Heavy overlap with 3.071 recipes (scaling, batch sizes)
  - Some overlap with 3.075 labor (production crew scheduling)
  - Connection to 1.096 scheduling libraries (custom builds)
