description: |
  Research on spaced repetition algorithms for optimal language learning retention.
  Focus on choosing between classic (SM-2), modern (FSRS), and advanced (SM-18) algorithms
  for personal language quiz tool implementation.

use_case: |
  Primary: Optimal review scheduling for language vocabulary retention
  - Schedule vocabulary reviews at optimal intervals for memory consolidation
  - Predict when learner will forget a word (forgetting curve)
  - Adapt intervals based on learner performance (correct/incorrect answers)
  - Integrate with language learning quiz system (Latin, Japanese, Russian, Czech)
  - Support 500-2000 vocabulary items with minimal overhead

algorithms_to_evaluate:
  - SM-2 (SuperMemo-2, 1987): Simple, proven, widely used baseline
  - SM-18 (SuperMemo-18, 2019): Complex, highest theoretical performance
  - FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler, 2022): Modern, open-source, good balance
  - Leitner System: Classic card-based approach with physical boxes

evaluation_criteria:
  - Implementation complexity (hours to implement, lines of code)
  - Memory retention effectiveness (% items remembered at 6 months)
  - Algorithmic overhead (milliseconds per card calculation)
  - Parameter tuning requirements (manual vs automatic optimization)
  - Research backing (peer-reviewed papers, user studies)
  - Integration patterns (standalone vs library integration)

key_questions:
  - Is SM-2 "good enough" for 90% of learners?
  - Does FSRS deliver measurably better retention than SM-2?
  - Is SM-18 complexity justified for personal use (not research)?
  - How to handle algorithm migration (SM-2 → FSRS with existing history)?

    - code: "1.140"
      title: Classical Language Libraries
      reason: Provides vocabulary content for quiz scheduling
  enables:
    - code: "1.142"
      title: Flashcard Systems
      reason: Scheduling algorithm for flashcard review
  complements:
    - code: "1.148"
      title: Morphological Analysis Libraries
      reason: Spaced repetition for multi-language vocabulary

strategic_value:
  - Foundation for language learning retention system
  - Zero marginal cost (runs on-device, no API)
  - Transferable across languages (Latin, Japanese, Russian, Czech)
  - Evidence-based learning optimization
  - Validates Path 1 (self-operated) for learning tools

key_findings:
  - FSRS is clear winner: 20-47× more popular than alternatives (7,324 vs 361 vs 156 downloads/month)
  - Adopted by Anki as official algorithm (v23.10+) - industry validation
  - Active maintenance (v6.3.0 October 2025, 118 commits)
  - Modern algorithm (2022) with academic backing (DSR model)
  - Open Spaced Repetition organization maintains both FSRS and legacy SM-2 implementations

recommendation: Use fsrs package (pip install fsrs)

discovery_method: S1-only
completion_notes: |
  S1 rapid discovery sufficient - popularity signal was decisive (20-47× leader).
  No need for S2-S4 when ecosystem has converged on clear winner.

  Anki's adoption of FSRS validates effectiveness. Same organization that maintains
  legacy SM-2 implementations built FSRS to replace them - strong signal.

notes: |
  This research demonstrates when S1 alone is sufficient: overwhelming popularity
  signal + industry adoption (Anki) + active maintenance = high confidence decision.

  Key trade-off resolved: FSRS more complex than SM-2 (21 parameters vs simple formula)
  but popularity + effectiveness justify the complexity.
