# Key Findings (S1)
key_insights:
  - "No open AI productivity standard - moderate lock-in (2-8h migration)"
  - "Cost varies 7× ($0 Reclaim free to $34 Motion)"
  - "Reclaim.ai best for most people (free tier, calendar-first, $8-12/month)"
  - "Motion best for advanced users (most powerful AI, $34/month)"
  - "ROI exceptional: 5-10h/month saved = $250-500 value, 10-60× ROI"

use_cases:
  - Knowledge workers managing 20-50 tasks across projects
  - Managers balancing meetings and deep work
  - Executives optimizing limited time for strategic work
  - Remote workers needing structure and accountability
  - ADHD/neurodivergent individuals needing external structure
  - Consultants juggling multiple clients and deadlines
  - Founders context-switching between product, sales, ops
  - Students balancing coursework, projects, and extracurriculars

target_personas:
  - Individual contributors (ICs) with complex workloads
  - Engineering managers with maker+manager schedules
  - Product managers coordinating cross-functional work
  - Consultants and fractional executives
  - Solo founders and solopreneurs
  - Knowledge workers with ADHD
  - Remote/distributed workers

key_decision_factors:
  - AI sophistication (auto-scheduling vs manual)
  - Calendar integration quality (Google, Outlook, Apple)
  - Task source integrations (Todoist, Asana, Linear, email)
  - Pricing ($8-34/month range)
  - Learning curve (setup time, AI calibration period)
  - Mobile app quality (iOS/Android)
  - Team features (shared scheduling, delegation)
  - Privacy and data security (AI training on your data?)

market_overview:
  market_leaders:
    ai_first:
      - Motion - Most advanced AI, $34/month, auto-schedules everything
      - Reclaim.ai - Calendar-focused, $8-12/month, habit scheduling
      - Trevor AI - Visual time blocking, $9.99/month, AI suggestions
      - Akiflow - Task aggregator, $19-34/month, AI scheduling
    guided_planning:
      - Sunsama - Daily planning ritual, $20/month, light AI
      - Structured - Minimalist planning, $14/month, basic scheduling
    traditional_comparison:
      - Todoist - Smart to-do list, $5/month, no AI scheduling
      - Things - Apple ecosystem, $50 one-time, no AI
  market_size: "~$500M-1B (productivity tools), AI segment emerging"
  growth_rate: "~50-100% YoY (AI productivity tools specifically)"
  typical_pricing: "$8-15/month (basic) to $20-40/month (premium)"

research_questions:
  - Which AI productivity tool has the most advanced scheduling algorithm?
  - How does AI auto-scheduling compare to manual time blocking (time saved)?
  - What's the learning period for AI to understand your patterns (weeks/months)?
  - When should you build custom productivity AI vs use Motion/Reclaim?
  - How do these tools handle team coordination vs individual work?
  - What's the privacy/security model (is your data used for AI training)?
  - How accurate are AI time estimates after calibration?
  - What integrations are must-haves (calendar, task list, email)?
