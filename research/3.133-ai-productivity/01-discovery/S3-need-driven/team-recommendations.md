# S3: Team Recommendations

**Focus**: When to use team plans vs individual plans

---

## Team Size Decision Matrix

### 2-5 Users: Individual Plans May Suffice

**Recommendation**: Start with individual plans
- **Why**: Team features minimal value at small scale
- **Cost**: 5 × $8 (Reclaim) = $40/month vs $50/month (team plan)
- **When to upgrade**: Need shared calendar visibility, team no-meeting days

---

### 5-20 Users: Team Plans Justified

**Reclaim Business** ($10/user/month):
- **Best for**: Calendar-heavy teams (sales, customer success, marketing)
- **Features**: Smart 1:1s, team calendar, no-meeting days, meeting analytics
- **Cost**: 10 users = $100/month, 20 users = $200/month
- **ROI**: 1-2 hours saved/user/month = 10-40 hours/month = $500-2,000 value

**Motion Teams** ($34/user/month):
- **Best for**: Project-heavy teams (engineering, product, design)
- **Features**: Shared projects, task assignment, workload balancing, capacity planning
- **Cost**: 10 users = $340/month, 20 users = $680/month
- **ROI**: 2-3 hours saved/user/month = 20-60 hours/month = $1,000-3,000 value

**Decision**: Calendar-heavy → Reclaim ($100-200/month), Project-heavy → Motion ($340-680/month)

### 20-50 Users: Consider Build vs Buy

**Threshold**: At 50+ users, custom solution may be cost-effective
- Motion: 50 users × $34 = $1,700/month = $20,400/year
- Custom build: $50-100k one-time + $5-10k/year maintenance
- **Break-even**: ~3-5 years (if building in-house)

**When to buy**: <50 users, standard workflow, need fast time-to-value
**When to build**: >100 users, unique workflow, privacy-critical (see S4)

---

## Team Adoption Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot (2-3 power users)
- **Duration**: 30 days
- **Goal**: Validate ROI (measure time saved, meeting load reduction)
- **Cost**: 3 users × $8-34 = $24-102/month

### Phase 2: Department Rollout (5-10 users)
- **Duration**: 60 days
- **Goal**: Team-wide adoption (no-meeting days, shared calendar)
- **Cost**: 10 users × $10-34 = $100-340/month

### Phase 3: Company-Wide (20+ users)
- **Duration**: 90+ days
- **Goal**: Cultural change (async-first, focus time protection)
- **Cost**: Varies by team plan

## Key Recommendations

- **2-5 users**: Individual plans ($8-34/user/month)
- **5-20 users**: Reclaim Business ($100-200/month) or Motion Teams ($340-680/month)
- **20-50 users**: Evaluate ROI (team plans) vs build custom
- **50+ users**: Consider build vs buy (see S4)
