**Founded**: 2019
**Headquarters**: Seattle, WA
**Public**: No (bootstrap + funding)
**Employees**: ~30-50

**Key Value Proposition**: "Your AI calendar" - smart scheduling without replacing your task system

---

## AI Capabilities

**AI Level**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)

### 1. Habit Scheduling AI
**What**: Recurring tasks optimized by AI (e.g., "Exercise 3× week, 1 hour")

**How it works**:
1. Define habit: "Deep work", 4 hours/day, Mon-Fri
2. AI finds best slots: Analyzes calendar, finds open blocks
3. Auto-schedules: Places habit in optimal times (e.g., 9-11 AM focus time)
4. Adapts: Meeting pops up → AI moves habit to next best slot

**Value**: Recurring commitments (exercise, deep work, learning) actually happen

---

### 2. Smart 1:1 Meeting Scheduling
**What**: AI finds optimal times for recurring 1:1s with team members

**Features**:
- **Mutual availability**: AI checks both calendars
- **Preference learning**: Notices you prefer Thu afternoons for 1:1s
- **Auto-rescheduling**: Conflict arises → AI finds new time, sends update

**Use case**: Managers with 5-10 direct reports (weekly 1:1s)

---

### 3. Buffer Time & Travel Time
**What**: AI adds buffer between meetings, accounts for travel

**Settings**:
- **Meeting buffer**: 10-15 min before/after meetings (decompression)
- **Travel time**: Office meetings → add commute time
- **Focus time recovery**: After long meetings, block recovery time

**Value**: Prevents back-to-back meeting burnout

---

### 4. Slack Status Sync
**What**: Updates Slack status based on calendar (in meeting, focus time, lunch)

**Example**:
- 9-11 AM: Focus time → Slack status "🎯 Deep work (back at 11)"
- 11-12 PM: Meeting → Slack status "📞 In a meeting"
- 12-1 PM: Lunch → Slack status "🍔 Lunch"

**Value**: Async communication (team knows when you're available)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Calendar-First Philosophy
**What**: Reclaim focuses on calendar optimization, not replacing your task system

**Integration approach**:
- **Tasks**: Sync from Todoist, Asana, Linear, Jira
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar, Outlook (bidirectional)
- **Result**: Tasks stay in source system, Reclaim just schedules them on calendar

**Value**: No lock-in to Reclaim's task system (unlike Motion)

---

### 2. Habits (Recurring Tasks)
**What**: AI-optimized recurring commitments

**Examples**:
- "Exercise 3× week, 1 hour each"
- "Deep work 4 hours/day"
- "Email admin 30 min/day"
- "Learning time 2 hours/week"

**AI optimization**: Finds best times based on calendar + your patterns

---

### 3. Defend Time
**What**: Protect focus time from meeting invites

**How**:
- Mark calendar blocks as "Busy" → people can't book over them
- Auto-decline meeting invites during focus time
- Suggest alternative times (outside focus hours)

**Value**: Prevent meeting spam from destroying deep work time

---

### 4. Personal & Work Calendar Sync
**What**: Sync work + personal calendars to avoid conflicts

**Use case**: Work calendar = meetings, personal calendar = doctor, gym
**Result**: Reclaim sees both, schedules tasks in truly free time

---

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
**What**: Track time allocation, meeting load, focus time achieved

**Metrics**:
- Focus time: 18 hours this week (target: 20 hours)
- Meetings: 15 hours (target: <20 hours)
- Task completion: 90% (scheduled tasks completed)
- Calendar utilization: 65% (workweek capacity)

**Value**: Data-driven time management optimization

---

## Performance Characteristics

**AI Accuracy** (after 1-2 week calibration):
- Habit placement: 85-90% optimal times
- Buffer time: 95%+ (rarely back-to-back meetings)
- Task scheduling: 80-85% accurate (less advanced than Motion)

**Setup Time**: 15-30 minutes (calendar + task integration + habits)
**Calibration Period**: 1-2 weeks (faster than Motion)
**Daily maintenance**: 5-10 minutes (adjust tasks, review schedule)

## Pros

✅ **Generous free tier** (unlimited habits + 10 tasks/week)
✅ **Affordable** ($8-12/month Pro, cheapest AI option)
✅ **Calendar-first** (no task system lock-in, integrates with existing tools)
✅ **Habit scheduling** (best for recurring commitments)

---

## Cons

❌ **Less powerful AI** (habit focus, not project-aware like Motion)
❌ **No dependencies** (doesn't understand task relationships)
❌ **Simple task model** (duration + deadline, no complexity)
❌ **Mobile app weaker** (desktop experience better)
❌ **Free tier limits** (10 tasks/week = need Pro for heavy task use)

---

## Best Use Cases

### ✅ Excellent For:
- **Calendar-heavy users** (lots of meetings, need focus time)
- **Managers** (smart 1:1s, team scheduling)
- **Habit building** (exercise, learning, deep work blocks)
- **Budget-conscious** ($8-12/month vs $34 Motion)
- **Existing task system** (happy with Todoist/Asana, just need scheduling)
- **Trying AI productivity** (free tier = low-risk trial)

### ⚠️ Consider Alternatives For:
- **Complex projects** (Motion better for dependencies)
- **Want all-in-one** (Motion includes task system)
- **Heavy task users** (free tier = 10 tasks/week, may not be enough)

---

## Migration Considerations

### Migrating TO Reclaim:
**Effort**: 15-30 minutes (connect calendar + task sources)
**Data**: Syncs from existing systems (no migration needed)
**Risk**: Low (integrates with existing tools, no disruption)

### Migrating FROM Reclaim:
**Effort**: 5-10 minutes (disconnect integrations)
**Lock-in**: VERY LOW
- Tasks stay in source system (Todoist, Asana)
- Calendar events stay in Google/Outlook
- Lost: AI scheduling preferences (but minimal, 1-2 week recalibration elsewhere)

---
