**Break-even**: Save >2 hours/year (or 10 min/month)

**Realistic time savings**: 5-10 hours/month
- Planning time: 2 hours/month (vs manual)
- Rescheduling: 1 hour/month (AI handles calendar changes)
- Decision fatigue: 2-5 hours/month ("what should I work on?")

**Value**: 60-120 hours/year × $50/hour = **$3,000-6,000/year**

**ROI**: 30-60× return on investment

---

### Motion ($228/year)

**Break-even**: Save >5 hours/year (or 25 min/month)

**Realistic time savings**: 10-15 hours/month
- Planning: 3 hours/month (project management + scheduling)
- Rescheduling: 2 hours/month (AI handles complex dependencies)
- Decision fatigue: 5-10 hours/month (AI decides task order)

**Value**: 120-180 hours/year × $50/hour = **$6,000-9,000/year**

**ROI**: 25-40× return on investment

---

### Trevor AI ($120/year subscription + $1,500/year time cost)

**Break-even**: Save >33 hours/year (or 2.75 hours/month)

**Realistic time savings**: 3-5 hours/month (vs pure manual)
- Time blocking: 2 hours/month (vs manual calendar)
- Visual planning: 1-3 hours/month (clearer priorities)

**Value**: 36-60 hours/year × $50/hour = **$1,800-3,000/year**

**ROI**: 1-1.8× (barely breaks even due to high time cost)

---

### Sunsama ($192/year subscription + $3,000/year time cost)

**Value**: 60-96 hours/year × $50/hour = **$3,000-4,800/year**

**ROI**: 0.9-1.5× (barely breaks even, loses money if <6h/month savings)

---

## 8. Hidden Costs & Considerations

### Context Switching Tax

**Motion/Reclaim (All-in-One/Integration)**:
- **Tools used**: 1-2 (Motion alone, or Reclaim + Todoist)
- **Context switches**: Low (everything in one place)

**Akiflow (Universal Inbox)**:
- **Tools used**: 5-7 (Todoist, Asana, Linear, Gmail, Slack, Akiflow)
- **Context switches**: High (must check Akiflow + source systems)
- **Hidden cost**: 30-60 min/week = $1,500-3,000/year

**Trevor/Sunsama (Manual)**:
- **Tools used**: 3-4 (Trevor + Todoist + calendar, or Sunsama + Todoist)
- **Context switches**: Moderate
- **Hidden cost**: Daily workflow = $1,500-3,000/year

---

### Calendar Clutter

**Motion**:
- Every task = calendar event (50+ blocks/day)
- **Hidden cost**: Cognitive overload, harder to see actual meetings
- **Mitigation**: Set minimum duration threshold (only block 30+ min tasks)

**Reclaim**:
- Habits + tasks = calendar events (20-30 blocks/day)
- **Less cluttered** than Motion (habit-focused, not all tasks)

**Trevor/Akiflow**:
- Manual time blocking = user controls clutter
- **Benefit**: Only important tasks on calendar

---

### AI Dependency Risk

**Motion/Reclaim**:
- If AI fails (service outage, AI breaks), schedule collapses
- **Mitigation**: Keep calendar as source of truth (fallback to manual)
- **Estimated risk**: <1% (rare outages)

**Trevor/Sunsama**:
- Manual planning = no AI dependency
- **Benefit**: Always works, no AI black box

---

## Verdict: Best TCO by Use Case

### Lowest TCO (Budget-Conscious): Reclaim Free or Todoist
- **Reclaim Free**: $125 year 1, $0 year 2+ (if <10 tasks/week)
- **Todoist**: $68 year 1, $60 year 2+ (no AI, manual calendar)

### Best Value (ROI): Reclaim Pro
- **TCO**: $221 year 1, $96 year 2+
- **Value**: $3,000-6,000/year (60-120h saved)
- **ROI**: 30-60×

### Premium (Justified for Power Users): Motion
- **TCO**: $503 year 1, $228 year 2+
- **Value**: $6,000-9,000/year (120-180h saved)
- **ROI**: 25-40×

### Avoid for Cost Reasons: Trevor AI, Sunsama
- **Trevor**: $1,770 year 1 (high time cost, daily workflow)
- **Sunsama**: $3,342 year 1 (very high time cost, manual planning)
- **Only worth it if**: You value mindfulness/control over cost efficiency

---

3. **Manual tools = low upfront, high ongoing**: Trevor/Sunsama cheap to start, expensive over time

4. **Reclaim Pro = best ROI**: $221 → $3,000-6,000 value (30-60× return)

5. **Motion justified for power users**: $503 → $6,000-9,000 value (25-40× return)

6. **Time cost often > subscription cost**: Daily workflows (Trevor, Sunsama) cost $1,500-3,000/year in time

**Recommendation**:
- **Budget** → Reclaim Free ($0) or Todoist ($60/year)
- **Value** → Reclaim Pro ($96/year, best ROI)
- **Power users** → Motion ($228/year, highest capability)
- **Avoid** → Trevor, Sunsama (high time costs)
