# S1 Rapid Library Search: Approach

## Methodology Philosophy

The S1 Rapid Library Search methodology prioritizes **SPEED and POPULARITY** over exhaustive analysis.
The core question driving this approach: **"What can I deploy TODAY to protect my application?"**

This methodology assumes that:
1. Popular solutions have proven reliability through mass adoption
2. Market leaders have better documentation, community support, and stability
3. Speed-to-deployment is critical in security scenarios
4. The best choice is often the most widely-used choice

## Discovery Strategy

### Time-Boxed Research (30 minutes max)
- Quick web searches for "top WAF providers 2025"
- Market share and popularity metrics
- User ratings from trusted sources (Gartner, G2, PeerSpot)
- Community buzz and active installations
- GitHub stars for open-source solutions

### Popularity Indicators
1. **Market Share**: Percentage of WAF market
2. **Active Users**: Number of installations/customers
3. **Ratings**: User satisfaction scores
4. **Mindshare**: Industry recognition and mentions
5. **Deployment Speed**: Time from signup to protection

### Selection Criteria

## Rapid Assessment Framework

Each provider evaluated on:
1. **Deployment Speed**: Minutes, hours, or days?
2. **Popularity Score**: Market position and user count
3. **Use Case Fit**: Startup vs enterprise vs specific workloads
4. **Confidence Level**: Based on data quality and consensus

## Discovery Tools Used

## Research Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Cloud-based/managed WAF solutions

- DDoS protection and bot management integration
- Rate limiting and IP management features

- **LOW**: Limited information, niche player, or conflicting reports

## Time Investment

This approach trades depth for speed, providing actionable recommendations based on
what the market has already validated through adoption and usage.
