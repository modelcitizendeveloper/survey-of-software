# Key Findings (S1)
key_insights:
  - "No open CDN standard exists - moderate lock-in (4-20h migration)"
  - "Cost varies 12× ($10/TB BunnyCDN to $120/TB Fastly)"
  - "Cloudflare best for 80% of teams (free tier → enterprise scale)"
  - "BunnyCDN best for cost optimization (10× cheaper than AWS/Fastly)"
  - "Fastly best for specific needs (instant purge <150ms, high-change-rate sites)"

title: "Content Delivery Network (CDN) Services"
domain: "Content Delivery & Performance"

scope:
  what_it_is: "Comprehensive analysis of CDN services for global content delivery and performance optimization"
  what_it_covers:
    - Global content distribution and edge caching
    - Bandwidth and pricing models
    - DDoS protection and security features
    - SSL/TLS certificate management
    - Image and asset optimization
    - Real-time analytics and logging
    - Edge compute capabilities
    - Cache purging and invalidation

  what_it_excludes:
    - Pure object storage without CDN (see 3.031 Object Storage)
    - Web application firewalls standalone (see 3.010 WAF)
    - Image processing services (see 3.032 Image Processing)
    - Video streaming platforms (separate category needed)
    - DNS services (separate from CDN caching)

      - Cloudflare - Free tier, 200+ PoPs, integrated security
      - AWS CloudFront - AWS ecosystem, enterprise features
      - Fastly - Edge compute, developer-focused
      - Akamai - Enterprise legacy leader, massive scale
    mid_market:
      - BunnyCDN - Budget-friendly, great value
      - KeyCDN - Simple pricing, solid performance
      - StackPath - Security-focused
    platform_integrated:
      - Vercel Edge Network - Next.js optimized
      - Netlify Edge - Jamstack sites
      - Google Cloud CDN - GCP integration
  market_size: "~$20 billion (2024) projected to $50 billion by 2030"
  growth_rate: "~15% CAGR (driven by video, global app growth)"
  typical_pricing: "$10-100/month (small) to $500-10,000+/month (enterprise)"

research_questions:
  - When does CDN cost justify the performance benefit?
  - How to choose between global giants vs budget CDNs?
  - When is Cloudflare free tier sufficient vs paid plans?
  - Multi-CDN strategy: When and how to implement?
  - CDN + object storage integration: Best practices?
  - How to optimize cache hit rate and reduce origin load?
  - When to use platform-integrated CDN vs standalone?
