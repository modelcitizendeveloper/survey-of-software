# S3 Need-Driven Discovery: Approach

**Goal:** Identify WHO needs community detection and WHY, focusing on real-world requirements.

**Time Budget:** 4-6 hours

**Methodology:**
1. Identify diverse user personas across industries
2. For each persona, define specific problems community detection solves
3. Map requirements → algorithm selection
4. Avoid implementation details (no code, no "how-to")

**Focus Areas:**
- **Who:** Specific job roles and their contexts
- **Why:** Business/research problems requiring community detection
- **Requirements:** Graph characteristics, quality needs, scale
- **Success criteria:** How they measure "good" communities

**Use Cases Selected:**
1. **Social media analysts** - Influencer identification
2. **Bioinformaticians** - Protein interaction analysis
3. **Cybersecurity teams** - Botnet and threat actor detection
4. **Urban planners** - Neighborhood identification from mobility
5. **Academic researchers** - Citation network analysis

**Validation Questions:**
- Does this persona actually exist?
- Is community detection the right tool for their problem?
- What do they care about (speed, quality, explainability)?
- What constraints do they face (data size, budget, expertise)?
