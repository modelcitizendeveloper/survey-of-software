# S2 Comprehensive Analysis: Approach

**Goal:** Deep technical understanding of community detection algorithms for informed implementation.

**Time Budget:** 1-2 days

**Methodology:**
1. Analyze algorithmic structure (phases, iterations, termination)
2. Examine complexity (time, space, convergence properties)
3. Evaluate quality guarantees (connectedness, optimality)
4. Compare API patterns and integration points
5. Benchmark performance characteristics on representative graphs

**Technical Focus:**
- **Algorithm internals:** Phase structure, update strategies, optimization targets
- **Complexity analysis:** Time/space bounds, scalability limits
- **Quality metrics:** Modularity, conductance, information-theoretic measures
- **API patterns:** Graph representation, parameter tuning, output formats

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Algorithmic guarantees (determinism, connectedness, convergence)
- Performance on graphs: 10K, 100K, 1M nodes
- Hyperparameter sensitivity
- Integration complexity with NetworkX/igraph/scikit-learn

**Libraries Analyzed:**
Same as S1, but with architectural deep-dives.
