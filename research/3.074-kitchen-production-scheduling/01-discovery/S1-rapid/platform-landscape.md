# S1 Rapid Discovery: Platform Landscape

**Research ID**: 3.074 - Production Scheduling (Commercial Kitchen)
**Discovery Phase**: S1 Rapid
**Date**: November 24, 2025
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

---

## Executive Summary

Commercial kitchen production scheduling sits at the intersection of **manufacturing MRP** (Katana, MRPeasy, BatchMaster) and **food-specific software** (FlexiBake, BakeSmart, Craftybase). The market shows clear segmentation:

- **Micro operations** (1-3 people): Spreadsheets or very simple tools ($0-50/mo)
- **Small bakeries/catering** (5-20 people): Food-specific platforms ($95-300/mo)
- **Medium operations** (20-100 people): General MRP with food features ($300-800/mo)
- **Enterprise** (100+ people): Full ERP systems (custom pricing)

**Key Finding**: Most commercial kitchens **don't buy production scheduling software** - they use spreadsheets, POS order management, or general project management tools. Dedicated production scheduling adoption is low outside wholesale bakeries and CPG manufacturers.

## Market Segmentation by Operation Size

### Micro (1-5 employees)
**Typical Operations**: Home bakeries, small catering, food truck prep
**Solution**: Spreadsheets ($0) or CakeBoss ($20/year)
**Why**: Production is simple enough to manage manually, can't justify $100+/mo

---

### Small (5-20 employees)
**Typical Operations**: Retail bakery with wholesale accounts, small catering company, meal prep service
**Solutions**:
- **Bakery-focused**: BakeSmart ($99/mo), FlexiBake Base ($295/mo)
- **General food**: Craftybase ($19+/mo), MRPeasy Starter ($49/mo)
- **Alternative**: ClickUp/Monday.com with custom workflows ($10-25/user/mo)

**Why**: Need production visibility but can't afford $500+/mo, often use lightweight tools or repurpose project management

---

### Medium (20-100 employees)
**Typical Operations**: Wholesale bakery, commissary kitchen, CPG food manufacturer
**Solutions**:
- **Bakery-specific**: FlexiBake Professional ($375/mo), Cybake (enterprise pricing)
- **General MRP**: Katana Standard/Professional ($359-799/mo), MRPeasy Professional/Enterprise ($75-149/mo)
- **Alternative**: Wherefour ($300-500/mo)

**Why**: Production complexity requires real software, multiple products/SKUs, multi-location, need integration with inventory and accounting

---

### Enterprise (100+ employees)
**Typical Operations**: Multi-facility bakeries, large CPG food brands, industrial food production
**Solutions**:
- BatchMaster Enterprise (SAP-based, custom pricing)
- FlexiBake Enterprise (custom pricing)

## Key Insights

### 1. Low Adoption Outside Wholesale
Most **restaurants, small bakeries, catering companies don't buy production scheduling software**. They use:
- Spreadsheets (most common)
- POS order management
- Project management tools (ClickUp, Monday.com)
- Mental planning (very small operations)

**Why**: Production is simple enough that dedicated software ROI doesn't justify $100-800/mo cost.

---

### 2. Bakery vs General Food Manufacturing
- **Bakeries** get better ROI from bakery-specific platforms (FlexiBake, BakeSmart, Cybake)
  - Bakery workflows are standardized (mixing, proofing, baking, cooling)
  - Recipe management is critical (flour, yeast, temperature, timing)
  - Lot tracking and expiry dates are regulatory requirements

- **General food manufacturers** use general MRP (Katana, MRPeasy, BatchMaster)
  - More diverse production workflows
  - Need flexibility vs bakery-specific assumptions
  - Often need integration with contract manufacturing, co-packing

---

### 3. Price Jumps at Feature Inflection Points
- **$0-50/mo**: Very basic (spreadsheets, order tracking)
- **$50-300/mo**: Real production scheduling, but limited locations/SKUs
- **$300-800/mo**: Multi-location, unlimited SKUs, advanced features
- **$800+/mo**: Enterprise features, multiple facilities, full ERP integration

**Implication**: Most small operations jump from spreadsheets ($0) directly to mid-tier platforms ($99-300/mo), skipping the micro tools.

---

### 4. Integration is Differentiator
Platforms that integrate with:
- **Accounting** (QuickBooks, Xero): MRPeasy, Katana, FlexiBake
- **POS systems**: FlexiBake, BakeSmart
- **Inventory management**: All MRP platforms
- **eCommerce**: BakeSmart, FlexiBake

**Winner**: FlexiBake (bakery-specific) and Katana (general food) offer deepest integration ecosystems.

---

### 5. Enterprise = Custom Pricing + SAP
Enterprise food manufacturing consolidates around:
- BatchMaster (built on SAP Business One)
- Full ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics 365 with food modules)

**Implication**: Small-medium operators avoid enterprise platforms due to cost and complexity.

---

## Gaps in Current Market

### 1. Affordable Production Scheduling for Small Catering
- **Gap**: Catering companies (5-20 employees) need multi-day production planning
- **Current Options**: Spreadsheets or repurpose project management tools
- **Missing**: $50-150/mo catering-specific production platform

### 2. Integration with Inventory Management
- **Gap**: Most platforms require buying their inventory module (expensive)
- **Current Options**: Buy full MRP/ERP or use separate systems
- **Missing**: Production scheduling that integrates with existing inventory (3.070 platforms)

### 3. Capacity Planning for Shared Equipment
- **Gap**: Commissary kitchens need equipment slot scheduling (oven #1 available 9-11am)
- **Current Options**: Google Calendar or spreadsheets
- **Missing**: Equipment capacity scheduling with production workflows

### 4. Mobile Production Tracking
- **Gap**: Kitchen staff need mobile apps to update production status
- **Current Options**: Desktop-only platforms (FlexiBake, BatchMaster) or basic mobile (Katana, MRPeasy)
- **Missing**: Mobile-first production tracking for kitchen floor
