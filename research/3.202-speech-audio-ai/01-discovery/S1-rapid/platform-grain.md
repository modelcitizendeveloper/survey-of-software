## 1. Overview

Grain is an AI-powered meeting recorder and conversation intelligence platform built specifically for customer-facing teams. Unlike general-purpose meeting assistants, Grain focuses on extracting business insights from customer conversations, making it ideal for sales, customer success, and product research teams.

The platform automatically joins meetings on Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams to record, transcribe, and analyze customer calls. Grain's AI doesn't just document meetings - it identifies buying signals, tracks competitor mentions, surfaces customer pain points, and connects conversation insights directly to business outcomes. The platform is powered by AssemblyAI's speech understanding models, ensuring high accuracy even in technical discussions.

Grain targets growing teams (10-100+ employees) who conduct frequent customer conversations and need to share insights across sales, product, marketing, and success functions. The platform's strength lies in its deep HubSpot integration and video clip creation capabilities, allowing teams to capture and share key moments from calls without forcing colleagues to watch entire recordings.
