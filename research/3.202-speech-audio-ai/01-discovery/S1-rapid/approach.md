- Free tier vs paid capabilities

### Category 2: Speech-to-Text APIs
Developer-focused APIs for integrating transcription into custom applications.

**Providers**:
5. OpenAI Whisper API
6. AssemblyAI
7. Deepgram
8. Rev AI

**Key Research Focus**:
- API architecture and ease of integration
- Real-time streaming vs batch processing
- Accuracy benchmarks and model details
- Cost per minute/hour economics
- Advanced features (diarization, sentiment, PII redaction)
- Language support breadth

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Primary Source Collection (Official Data)
For each provider:
1. **Official website** - Product overview, value proposition, positioning
2. **Pricing page** - Current pricing (Nov 2024), tier structure, limits
3. **Documentation** - Technical specs, API reference, model details
4. **Blog/newsroom** - Recent announcements (2024-2025), feature launches

### Phase 2: Third-Party Validation
For each provider:
1. **User reviews** - G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for meeting platforms
2. **Developer feedback** - Stack Overflow, GitHub, dev forums for APIs
3. **Comparison articles** - Tech blogs, industry analysis (2024+)
4. **Benchmarks** - Published accuracy tests, latency measurements

### Phase 3: Competitive Analysis
1. **Feature matrix** - Common capabilities across all 8 providers
2. **Pricing comparison** - TCO for typical use cases
3. **Differentiation** - Unique strengths per provider
4. **Market positioning** - Target customer segments

## Information Collection Framework

For each provider, document the following 8 dimensions:

### 1. Overview (2-3 paragraphs)
- Product type (meeting bot vs API)
- Core value proposition
- Target customer segment
- Company background (if relevant to credibility)

### 2. Key Features (structured list)
- Transcription accuracy (% if claimed)
- Real-time vs asynchronous
- Speaker diarization (yes/no, quality)
- AI summarization (meeting notes, action items)
- Platform integrations (Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex)
- Languages supported (count + major languages)
- Unique differentiators

### 3. Pricing (exact figures)
- Free tier: limits, features
- Starter tier: price, limits, target user
- Professional/Business tier: price, limits
- Enterprise: pricing model, custom features
- API providers: cost per minute/hour, free credits

### 4. Technical Details
- AI model (Whisper, proprietary, custom)
- API availability (REST, WebSocket, SDKs)
- Latency (real-time delay if applicable)
- Audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Max file size/duration
- Data retention defaults

### 5. Integration & Ecosystem
- Calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Webex)
- CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive)
- Productivity (Slack, Notion, Asana, Trello)
- Export formats (JSON, TXT, PDF, SRT, VTT)

### 6. Privacy & Compliance
- Data storage region (US, EU, multi-region)
- GDPR compliance (yes/no)
- HIPAA BAA availability (yes/no)
- SOC 2 certification
- Data retention policy (days/configurable)
- Encryption (at rest, in transit)

### 7. Pros & Cons (3-5 each)
**Based on**:
- User reviews (G2, Capterra)
- Documentation quality assessment
- Competitive feature comparison
- Pricing value analysis

### 8. Best For (use cases)
- Team size (individual, small team, enterprise)
- Industry (sales, legal, medical, general)
- Use case (meeting notes, interview transcription, API integration)

---

## Research Constraints

### Time Box
- Per provider: 30-45 minutes deep research
- Total S1 phase: 4-6 hours

### Quality Standards
1. **Accuracy**: Only cite verifiable facts from official sources
2. **Currency**: Prioritize 2024-2025 data; flag if older
3. **Neutrality**: No subjective recommendations, factual comparison only
4. **Completeness**: Fill all 8 dimensions; note if data unavailable

### Source Credibility Hierarchy
1. **Tier 1**: Official website, documentation, pricing pages
2. **Tier 2**: Published benchmarks, industry reports
3. **Tier 3**: Aggregated user reviews (G2, Capterra)
4. **Tier 4**: Tech blog comparisons (verify claims)

## Deliverables

### Individual Provider Profiles (8 files)
- `platform-fireflies.md`
- `platform-otter.md`
- `platform-grain.md`
- `platform-fathom.md`
- `api-whisper.md`
- `api-assemblyai.md`
- `api-deepgram.md`
- `api-revai.md`

**Format**: Markdown, structured per 8-dimension framework above

### Synthesis Document
- `recommendations.md`
  - Comparison table (8 providers x key dimensions)
  - Category insights (meeting platforms vs APIs)
  - Pricing analysis (TCO scenarios)
  - Feature gaps and market opportunities
  - Next steps for S2 (Systematic Analysis)

---

## Success Criteria

S1 Rapid Discovery is complete when:
1. All 8 provider profiles contain factual data across 8 dimensions
2. Pricing is current (Nov 2024) with specific figures
3. Technical capabilities are clearly documented
4. Synthesis document provides actionable comparison
5. Knowledge gaps are identified for deeper S2 research

---

## Next Phase Preview: S2 Systematic Analysis

After S1, the research will deepen with:
- Hands-on testing (free trials, API experimentation)
- Accuracy benchmarking (same audio across all providers)
- Integration testing (setup complexity, API latency)
- TCO modeling (real usage scenarios)
- Feature depth testing (summarization quality, diarization accuracy)

S1 provides the foundation for informed S2 experimentation.
