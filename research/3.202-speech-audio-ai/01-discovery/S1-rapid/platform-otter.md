## 1. Overview

Otter.ai is a real-time AI transcription platform that transforms spoken conversations into searchable, shareable text notes. As a meeting assistant platform, Otter automatically joins video calls, generates live captions, and produces AI-generated summaries complete with action items and key takeaways.

The platform was developed using deep machine learning trained on millions of hours of audio recordings, creating a speech recognition system optimized for meeting contexts. Otter uses AI natural language processing to not only transcribe speech accurately but also to understand context, identify speakers, and extract meaningful insights from conversations.

Otter.ai targets professionals, teams, and students who need reliable meeting documentation across Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. The platform emphasizes ease of use, collaboration features (shared notes, inline commenting), and accessibility (live captions for hearing impaired). Otter is particularly popular in education, journalism, and business settings where accurate transcription and searchability are essential.
