- User community feedback

### 4. Comparison Matrices

Created three comprehensive matrices:

**Feature Matrix:**
- Rows: 10 providers
- Columns: 20+ key features
- Values: Yes/No/Limited/Paid Add-on

**Pricing Matrix:**
- Standardized comparison at common volume tiers:
  - Personal/Blog: 10K pageviews/month
  - Small Business: 100K pageviews/month
  - Mid-Market: 1M pageviews/month
  - Enterprise: 10M+ pageviews/month

**Privacy Matrix:**
- GDPR/CCPA compliance status
- Cookie requirements
- Anonymization methods
- Data residency options
- Impact on analytics accuracy

### 5. Key Trade-offs Identified

Through this analysis, we identified critical decision points:

**Privacy vs Features:**
- Privacy-first tools (Plausible, Fathom) = Simple but limited
- Full-featured tools (GA4, Adobe) = Powerful but complex compliance

**Cost vs Control:**
- Free (GA4) = No cost but privacy concerns
- Paid SaaS ($10-50/mo) = Clean privacy, limited features
- Self-hosted (Matomo, Umami) = Full control, ops burden

**Simplicity vs Depth:**
- Basic analytics = Quick insights, missing attribution
- Advanced analytics = Complete picture, steep learning curve

### 6. Documentation Structure

**Provider Profiles:**
Each provider gets a detailed profile covering:
- Overview and positioning
- Feature breakdown
- Complete pricing tiers
- Privacy/compliance analysis
- Integration methods
- Pros and cons
- Best fit scenarios

**Comparison Matrices:**
- Feature matrix for quick capability comparison
- Pricing matrix for cost planning
- Privacy matrix for compliance assessment

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- Decision tree for provider selection
- Use case to solution mapping
- Migration paths and considerations

## Key Findings Preview

**Market Segmentation:**
1. **Privacy-First** (Plausible, Fathom, Simple Analytics): $10-50/month, cookie-free, GDPR-compliant by design
2. **Enterprise** (Adobe, Piwik PRO): $100K+/year, unsampled data, advanced segmentation
3. **Free Full-Featured** (GA4, Cloudflare): $0, powerful but privacy tradeoffs
4. **Self-Hosted** (Umami, Matomo): Free software, infrastructure costs, full control
5. **Product Analytics** (PostHog, Mixpanel): Event-focused, developer-centric, usage-based pricing

**Privacy Landscape Shift:**
- Cookie-less analytics now mainstream (2025)
- EU data residency increasingly required
- "Privacy by design" becoming competitive advantage
- Consent management adds complexity to traditional tools

**Pricing Models Evolution:**
- Usage-based pricing (pageviews/events) now dominant
- Self-hosted remains cheapest for high-volume
- Enterprise pricing highly negotiable ($100K-$350K range)
- Free tiers more generous than 2023-2024
