# S4 Strategic Selection: String Metric Libraries

## Methodology

Long-term viability analysis considering ecosystem fit, maintenance burden, and architectural implications.

**Research approach:**
- Ecosystem health assessment (community size, funding, governance)
- Total cost of ownership (licensing, support, maintenance)
- Team capability alignment (existing skills, hiring market)
- Vendor/dependency risk analysis
- Backwards compatibility and migration paths

**Strategic concerns:**
- WHEN: Multi-year horizon (not just current sprint)
- WHO: Decision-makers balancing tech debt, team growth, risk
- WHY: Long-term sustainability over short-term optimization
- WHAT: Organizational context, not just technical features

**Time investment:** 3-5 hours for strategic analysis

**Goal:** Provide decision criteria for library selection that accounts for organizational realities beyond raw performance and features.
