# S1 Rapid Discovery: String Metric Libraries

## Methodology

Speed-focused ecosystem survey for quick decision-making on string similarity measurement libraries.

**Research approach:**
- GitHub star counts and community adoption
- Package manager download statistics (PyPI, npm, crates.io)
- Stack Overflow mention frequency
- Active maintenance signals (recent commits, issue response times)
- Common recommendation patterns in developer communities

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours for ecosystem mapping

**Goal:** Identify the 5-7 most popular and well-maintained libraries across major ecosystems with clear feature distinctions for rapid selection.
