# S3 Need-Driven Discovery: String Metric Libraries

## Methodology

User-centered research identifying WHO needs string similarity metrics and WHY, organized by persona and use case.

**Research approach:**
- Persona identification (roles, contexts, constraints)
- Use case analysis (specific problems string metrics solve)
- Requirements validation (must-haves vs nice-to-haves)
- Success criteria (what "good enough" looks like)

**Focus:**
- WHO: User personas and their contexts
- WHY: Business drivers and pain points
- WHEN: Triggering conditions for adoption
- WHAT: Specific requirements and constraints

**NOT covered in S3:**
- HOW to implement (that's S2)
- WHICH library to choose (that's S4)

**Time investment:** 4-6 hours for persona research and use case documentation

**Goal:** Map real-world needs to string metric capabilities, helping readers recognize their own use cases and validate library fit.
