# S4-Strategic: Approach

## Philosophy
"Think long-term and consider broader context" - strategic insights for multi-year architectural decisions.

## Methodology

### Time Horizon
S4 looks **2-5 years ahead**:
- Will this library still be maintained?
- How will the ecosystem evolve?
- What are the exit costs if we need to change?
- What skills will our team need long-term?

### Strategic Dimensions Analyzed

1. **Ecosystem Momentum**:
   - Which annotation standards are winning? (UD vs others)
   - Where is NLP research headed? (transformers, multilingual models)
   - What are practitioners adopting? (GitHub trends, paper citations)

2. **Vendor/Project Stability**:
   - Who maintains the library? (individual, institution, company)
   - How active is development? (release cadence, GitHub activity)
   - What's the funding model? (academic grants, open-source, commercial)

3. **Technical Debt Assessment**:
   - Migration costs if switching libraries (API changes, retraining)
   - Lock-in risks (proprietary formats, unique dependencies)
   - Skill investment (training team, hiring for specific tools)

4. **Community and Knowledge**:
   - How easy to find experts? (Stack Overflow, job market)
   - Quality of documentation (beginner-friendly vs expert-only)
   - Third-party ecosystem (tutorials, courses, integrations)

## What S4 Covers

- Long-term viability of each library (2-5 year horizon)
- Ecosystem trends that affect all tools (UD adoption, transformer dominance)
- Exit strategies and migration paths
- Team building and skill acquisition
- Strategic risks and hedging strategies

## What S4 Doesn't Cover

- Short-term tactical decisions (→ S3)
- Technical implementation details (→ S2)
- Quick evaluation (→ S1)

## Information Sources

- Academic trends (citation analysis, conference proceedings)
- GitHub metrics (stars, commits, contributor diversity)
- Job market signals (demand for skills on LinkedIn, etc.)
- Vendor stability indicators (funding, institutional backing)
- Standards adoption (UD growth, CoNLL shared tasks)

## Confidence Level

**60-70% confidence** - S4 is forward-looking and speculative. Technology evolution is uncertain. Recommendations are directional guidance, not guarantees. Validate assumptions annually, reassess strategy as ecosystem evolves.

## Strategic Questions S4 Answers

1. **Which library is safest long-term bet?** (maintenance, community, standards)
2. **What ecosystem trends should inform our choice?** (UD adoption, transformer models)
3. **How do we mitigate risk if library declines?** (exit strategies, fallback plans)
4. **What skills should we invest in?** (team training, hiring)
5. **When should we reconsider this decision?** (signals to watch, decision triggers)
