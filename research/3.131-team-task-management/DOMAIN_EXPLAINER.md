# Team Task Management: Domain Explainer

**For**: MBA/Finance/Business audiences unfamiliar with task management software
**Purpose**: Explain what team task management is, why teams need it, and the business context

---

## What is Team Task Management?

**Team task management** is software that helps small teams (3-20 people) coordinate work, track progress, and collaborate on projects.

Think of it as a **shared to-do list on steroids**: everyone can see what needs to be done, who's doing what, when things are due, and how work is progressing.

### The Problem it Solves

**Without team task management**:
- Work tracked in spreadsheets, email, Slack messages (scattered)
- No visibility: "Who's working on what?"
- Dropped tasks: "I thought YOU were handling that"
- Duplicate effort: "We both did the same thing"
- Status meetings: "What's your update?" (everyone goes around the room)

**With team task management**:
- Single source of truth for all work
- Real-time visibility into who's doing what
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Automatic status updates (no meetings needed)
- Collaboration features (comments, file attachments, mentions)

## Who Uses Team Task Management?

### Team Size: 3-20 people

**Too small** (1-2 people):
- Personal productivity tools work fine (Todoist, Things 3)
- Overhead of team features not worth it
- Typically graduates to team tools at 3-5 people

**Too large** (20+ people):
- Need enterprise project management (Jira, Microsoft Project)
- Require SSO, compliance, portfolio management
- Multiple teams need coordination across projects

**Sweet spot** (3-20 people):
- Small enough to move fast (not enterprise bureaucracy)
- Large enough to need coordination (not solo)
- Examples: startup teams, agencies, consulting firms, internal departments

### Team Types

1. **Software development teams** (5-10 engineers)
   - Track features, bugs, sprints
   - Kanban boards, issue tracking
   - Examples: Linear, ClickUp, Asana

2. **Marketing/Creative agencies** (8-15 people)
   - Campaign planning, content calendar
   - Client work tracking, approvals
   - Examples: Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp

3. **Consulting firms** (5-12 consultants)
   - Client projects, deliverables
   - Time tracking, task assignments
   - Examples: Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com

4. **Remote/distributed teams** (anywhere, any industry)
   - Async communication critical
   - Need strong mobile apps, notifications
   - Examples: Linear, Asana, ClickUp

- **Real-time updates**: Everyone sees changes instantly

### 2. **Permission Models**
- **Owner**: Full control, billing, delete workspace
- **Admin**: Manage users, projects, settings
- **Member**: Create tasks, edit assigned work

### 3. **Multiple Views**
- **List view**: Traditional to-do list (task, assignee, due date)
- **Board view**: Kanban columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Calendar view**: Timeline of due dates
- **Gantt/Timeline**: Project dependencies, critical path

### 4. **Integrations**
- **Slack**: Notifications, create tasks from messages
- **Email**: Create tasks from emails, notifications
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Link code commits to tasks
- **Google Drive/Dropbox**: Attach files

## Pricing Models (Per-Seat Pricing)

Unlike personal tools ($5-10/month flat), team tools charge **per user per month**.

### Typical Pricing Tiers

**Free tier**: 2-5 users, limited features
- Good for: Trying out, very small teams
- Limitations: No advanced features, limited storage

**Team tier**: $8-15/user/month
- Good for: 3-20 people, most common
- Includes: All core features, integrations, automation

**Business tier**: $15-25/user/month
- Good for: Larger teams, more automation
- Includes: Advanced reporting, custom fields, priority support

**Enterprise tier**: $25-50/user/month (or custom quote)
- Good for: 50+ users, compliance needs
- Includes: SSO, SAML, dedicated support, SLAs

### Cost Examples

**Team of 5**: $8/user × 5 = $40/month ($480/year)
**Team of 10**: $12/user × 10 = $120/month ($1,440/year)
**Team of 20**: $15/user × 20 = $300/month ($3,600/year)

## Graduation Triggers (When Teams Switch)

### From Personal → Team (3.130 → 3.131)

**Triggers**:
- Team grows from 2 to 3-5 people
- Coordination overhead increases (too many Slack messages)
- Work gets dropped (no shared visibility)
- Manager needs status visibility without asking

**Typical path**: Individual uses Todoist → Team tries Trello (free) → Graduates to Asana/ClickUp (need features)

### From Team → Enterprise (3.131 → 3.132)

**Triggers**:
- Team grows from 20 to 30+ people
- Multiple teams need to coordinate
- Security/compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Need SSO, SAML, advanced permissions
- Portfolio management (track multiple projects)

**Typical path**: Startup uses Asana → 50 employees, switches to Jira (enterprise features)

---

## Decision Framework (How Teams Choose)

### Step 1: Team Type & Size
- **Dev team 5-10 people**: Linear (developer-focused)
- **Marketing team 8-12 people**: Asana (cross-functional)
- **Agency 10-15 people**: Monday.com (client-facing)

### Step 2: Simplicity vs Features
- **Simple, visual**: Trello, Monday.com
- **Balanced**: Asana
- **Power users, customization**: ClickUp

### Step 3: Budget
- **Free/low-cost**: Trello free tier, Asana free (up to 15)
- **Standard**: $8-12/user/month (most platforms)
- **Premium features needed**: $15-20/user/month

### Step 4: Integrations
- **Slack-native**: Linear, Asana
- **API/automation heavy**: ClickUp, Airtable
- **Ecosystem lock-in**: Check if your existing tools integrate

### Step 5: Migration Complexity
- **Switching cost is HIGH**: Data migration, team training, workflow changes
- **Lock-in risk**: Once team is trained, hard to switch (even if better option exists)

## Competitive Positioning Insights

### What Incumbents Do Well
- **Asana**: Balance of simplicity and power, strong onboarding
- **ClickUp**: Extreme customization, "replace all your tools"
- **Linear**: Speed, keyboard shortcuts, developer UX
- **Monday.com**: Visual appeal, non-technical user friendly

### Common Industry Weaknesses
- **AI is nascent**: Task prioritization, scheduling mostly manual (features launched 2024-2025)
- **Natural language limited**: Form-based task creation (structured input required)
- **Automation rigid**: Rule-based workflows, not adaptive
- **Context switching**: Require opening app, navigating, clicking to manage tasks

### Market Gaps Observed
- **Conversational interfaces**: No platform offers natural language task management
- **Proactive intelligence**: Platforms are passive (user must check for updates)
- **Context-aware reminders**: Calendar-based only, not intelligent
- **Meeting users where they are**: Integrations exist, but still require context switching

**Note**: These gaps represent potential opportunities for new entrants or product differentiation strategies.
