## 8. Ideal Customer Profile

### Team Size Sweet Spot

- Small enough to manage data complexity
- Teams with unique workflows (not standard PM)

**Can work**: 3-100 people
- 3-5 people: Expensive per user, but powerful
- 30-100 people: Works if budget allows
- 100+ people: Enterprise plan available

**Not ideal**: 1-2 people or cost-sensitive teams
- 1-2 people: $20/user too expensive for solo/tiny teams
- Budget-conscious: ClickUp $7, Asana $11 much cheaper

### Industry / Use Case Fit

**Best for**:
1. **Teams with structured data needs**: Inventory, CRM, databases
2. **Creative agencies**: Track clients, projects, assets, invoices in linked tables
3. **Marketing teams**: Campaign tracking, content calendar with rich data
4. **Operations teams**: Process management with custom data structures
5. **Product teams**: Feature planning with linked tables (customers, features, releases)
6. **Teams that outgrew spreadsheets**: Need database power, not ready for full dev work

**Not ideal for**:
1. **Traditional PM**: Asana/Monday better for standard task management
2. **Software development**: Linear/Jira better for code-centric workflows
3. **Simple projects**: Trello sufficient (Airtable overkill)
4. **Budget-conscious teams**: Too expensive ($20/user)
5. **Non-technical teams needing fast start**: Setup time too long

### Technical vs Non-Technical Users

**Non-technical friendly**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)

- Good middle ground between spreadsheets and custom DB

### Key Decision Criteria

Choose Airtable if you value:
1. **Flexibility** (build custom workflows, CRM, databases)
2. **Relational data** (linked tables, rollups, lookups)
3. **Data management** (need database power, not just tasks)
4. **Unique workflows** (standard PM tools don't fit)
5. **No-code platform** (build custom apps without coding)

Skip Airtable if you need:
