## Key Findings: Universal Patterns

### Table Stakes Features (Standard Across All Platforms)

From analyzing 6 platforms, these features are **universal** (all or most platforms have them):

1. **Task creation**: Title, description, assignee, due date
2. **Multiple views**: At least 3-4 views (list, board, calendar)
3. **Comments & mentions**: @mentions, threaded discussions
4. **Automation**: Rule-based workflows (250-25,000 actions/month)
5. **Mobile apps**: iOS & Android with push notifications
6. **Integrations**: At minimum Slack, Google Workspace, Calendar
7. **Collaboration**: Real-time updates, activity feeds
8. **Custom fields**: Extend task data (priority, status, tags)
9. **File attachments**: Drag-and-drop files
10. **Search**: Find tasks by keyword, assignee, date

**Implication**: These features are **minimum requirements** for any competitive team task management tool.

### Differentiating Features (Where Platforms Diverge)

Features that **vary significantly** across platforms:

1. **Natural language task creation**:
   - **Current state**: All platforms require forms (title, description, due date, assignee)
   - **Variation**: Some have better quick-add (Linear's Cmd+K), but all are form-based
   - **Opportunity gap**: True natural language parsing not available

2. **Conversational interfaces**:
   - **Current state**: All platforms are UI-based (click, navigate, find task)
   - **Variation**: Linear fastest (keyboard shortcuts), others mouse-driven
   - **Opportunity gap**: No platform offers conversational "What should I work on next?"

3. **AI capabilities maturity**:
   - **Current state**: Most platforms launched AI 2024-2025 (very new)
   - **Variation**: Asana AI Studio most advanced, Trello/Linear minimal
   - **Features**: Task suggestions, summaries, auto-categorization (basic)
   - **Opportunity gap**: Proactive intelligence, context-aware prioritization

4. **Multi-assignment support**:
   - **Supported**: ClickUp, Monday.com, Airtable
   - **Not supported**: Asana, Linear, Trello (single assignee only)
   - **Workarounds**: Subtasks, task duplication (clunky)

5. **Integration depth**:
   - **Wide**: Asana (200+), Trello (200+ Power-Ups)
   - **Narrow**: Linear (20), focused on developer tools
   - **Implication**: Integration count doesn't equal quality; focus matters

### Pricing Patterns

**Team tier pricing** (per user per month, annual):

- **Budget tier**: $5-7 (Trello, ClickUp)
- **Standard tier**: $8-12 (Linear, Asana, Monday)
- **Premium tier**: $20-54 (Airtable)
- **AI add-ons**: +$6-7/user (ClickUp Brain, Airtable AI)

**Cost variance**: 4x difference between cheapest (Trello $5) and most expensive (Airtable $20)

**AI pricing models**:
- **Included**: Asana (AI in base plan)
- **Add-on**: ClickUp (+$7), Airtable (+$6)
- **None**: Linear, Trello (minimal/no AI)

### Integration Universality

**Must-have integrations** (present in all 6 platforms):

1. **Slack**: Create tasks, notifications, updates
2. **Email**: Create tasks from emails, email notifications
3. **Google Calendar**: Sync due dates, calendar view
4. **Mobile apps**: iOS/Android with push notifications

**Common integrations** (most platforms, not all):

5. **GitHub/GitLab**: Code integration (developer-focused tools)
6. **Zapier**: 5,000+ app ecosystem connections
7. **Zoom**: Meeting recording attachments
8. **Google Drive/Dropbox**: File storage integration

**Implication**: Slack, email, calendar, mobile are **non-negotiable** for market competitiveness.

### Market Gaps & Weaknesses

**Common weaknesses across platforms**:

1. **AI capabilities nascent**:
   - Most platforms launched AI features 2024-2025
   - Limited to: task suggestions, summaries, auto-categorization
   - Missing: Conversational interface, proactive intelligence, context-aware prioritization

2. **Form-based task creation**:
   - All platforms require structured input (title, description, due date, assignee)
   - Quick-add shortcuts exist (Linear Cmd+K), but still forms
   - Natural language parsing not available

3. **Context switching required**:
   - Must open app, navigate to project, find task
   - Even with Slack/email integrations, requires context switch
   - Friction reduces task capture rate

4. **Passive platforms**:
   - User must check platform for updates
   - Calendar-based reminders only (not context-aware)
   - No proactive intelligence ("You forgot about X")

5. **Multi-assignment gaps**:
   - 3 platforms don't support (Asana, Linear, Trello)
   - Workarounds required for collaborative tasks
   - Even platforms that support it have clunky UI
