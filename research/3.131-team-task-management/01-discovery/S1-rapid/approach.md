## Key Questions to Answer

**For each platform**:
1. What makes this platform unique?
2. Why would a team choose THIS over alternatives?
3. What's the pricing sweet spot (team size)?
4. How mature are AI capabilities?
5. How easy is it to migrate in/out?
6. What integrations are make-or-break?

**Cross-platform**:
1. What features are table stakes (everyone has)?
2. What features differentiate (only some have)?
3. Where is there NO clear winner? (personal preference)
4. Where are there gaps? (LLM-GTD opportunity)

1. **Feature comparison table** (high-level, detailed in S2)
2. **Pricing comparison** (5, 10, 20 user scenarios)
3. **Positioning map** (simplicity vs features, visual vs data)
4. **Quick match guide** (team type → platform recommendation)
5. **Key findings** for LLM-GTD competitive positioning

## Time Allocation

**Per platform** (full depth): ~60-90 minutes
- Research: 30-40 minutes
- Writing: 25-35 minutes
- Cross-checking: 5-10 minutes

**Total S1 time**: 6-9 hours (6 platforms × 60-90 min)

**Synthesis**: 1-2 hours

**S1 total**: 7-11 hours
