# S1 Rapid Pass: Approach

## Objective
Quick survey of available libraries for tone analysis and pitch detection in CJK languages, focusing on:
- Pitch/F0 detection capabilities
- Tone verification for pronunciation practice
- Tone sandhi rule implementation potential

## Research Method
- Web search for current (2026) documentation and examples
- Focus on two primary libraries: librosa and praatio
- Evaluate core capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses for CJK tone analysis

## Scope
- **librosa**: Pure Python audio analysis library
- **praatio**: Python wrapper for Praat TextGrid manipulation
- **Bonus discovery**: Parselmouth (direct Praat access from Python)

## Key Questions
1. Which library provides most accurate pitch detection?
2. What are integration requirements (dependencies, external tools)?
3. Can these libraries support tone sandhi rule detection?
4. Which approach is better for batch processing vs. interactive use?

## Time Investment
Initial research pass completed in single session.
