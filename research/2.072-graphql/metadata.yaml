  Research on GraphQL as an open API design standard. Focus on portability
  across implementations, migration costs, and lock-in assessment.

  GraphQL Foundation (Linux Foundation) specification enables schema-first,
  client-driven API design with built-in introspection.

use_case: |
  Primary: API design portability across server implementations
  - Schema-first contract-driven development
  - Switch between Node.js, Postgres-native, Python, Go implementations
  - Federation patterns without vendor lock-in
  - Minimize proprietary extensions (Apollo Federation concerns)

key_questions:
  - How portable are GraphQL schemas across implementations?
  - What is the migration cost between implementations?
  - Which features are standard vs proprietary?
  - How does Apollo Federation create lock-in?
  - GraphQL vs REST/gRPC for portability?

implementations_to_analyze: 7
implementations:
  - Apollo Server (Node.js, most popular)
  - Hasura (Haskell, auto-generates from Postgres)
  - Postgraphic (Postgres-native)
  - GraphQL Yoga (Node.js, lightweight)
  - Hot Chocolate (.NET)
  - Strawberry (Python)
  - gqlgen (Go)
  - Juniper (Rust)

  complements:
    - code: "2.070"
      title: OpenAPI/REST
      reason: GraphQL is alternative/complement to REST for API design
    - code: "2.071"
      title: gRPC
      reason: Both are alternatives to REST, different strengths

research_priorities:
  - Schema portability across implementations
  - Migration cost analysis (switching servers)
  - Federation patterns (Apollo vs open standards)
  - Lock-in assessment (proprietary extensions)
  - GraphQL vs REST/gRPC comparison

notes: |
  This is a Tier 2 (Open Standards) experiment, so focus is on STANDARD
  portability, not specific implementation selection. Server implementations
  are Tier 1 concerns.

  GraphQL differs from OpenAPI/REST and gRPC by providing:
  - Client-driven queries (no over/under-fetching)
  - Built-in introspection (schema discovery)
  - Strong typing (schema-first)
  - Single endpoint (vs resource-based REST)

  Key concern: Apollo Federation proprietary extensions may create lock-in
  despite GraphQL spec being open. Need to evaluate open federation alternatives.
