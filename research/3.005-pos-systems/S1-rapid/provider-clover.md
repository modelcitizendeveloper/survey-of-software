## Cost Comparison Example

**Hypothetical Scenario:** Retail store, 1 location, $30,000/month revenue

### Clover Costs (Monthly)
- Software (Standard): $84.95/mo
- Processing (2.3% on $30K): $690/mo
- Loyalty app: $30/mo (example)
- **Total: ~$805/mo** + hardware ($1,799 upfront or $72/mo lease)

### Square Costs (Monthly)
- Software (Plus): $89/mo
- Processing (2.6% on $30K): $780/mo
- Loyalty: Included
- **Total: ~$869/mo** + hardware ($299-$799 upfront)

**Analysis:** Clover slightly cheaper at high volume due to lower processing rates, but higher hardware cost and potential app subscriptions can offset savings.
