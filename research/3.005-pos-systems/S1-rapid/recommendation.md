## Processing Fee Sensitivity Analysis

### When Free POS (Higher Processing Fees) Makes Sense

**Example: Low-volume retail shop, $10,000/month revenue**

**Square Free:**
- Software: $0/mo
- Processing (2.6% on $10K): $260/mo
- **Total: $260/mo**

**Lightspeed ($89/mo, 2.6%):**
- Software: $89/mo
- Processing (2.6% on $10K): $260/mo
- **Total: $349/mo**

**Conclusion:** Square Free saves $89/mo at low volume

---

### When Paid POS (Lower Processing Fees) Makes Sense

**Example: High-volume restaurant, $100,000/month revenue**

**Square Free:**
- Software: $0/mo
- Processing (2.6% on $100K): $2,600/mo
- **Total: $2,600/mo**

**Toast Paid Plan ($69/mo, 2.49%):**
- Software: $69/mo
- Processing (2.49% on $100K): $2,490/mo
- **Total: $2,559/mo**

**Conclusion:** Toast saves $41/mo at high volume, PLUS better restaurant features

**Break-even point:** Typically $50,000-$75,000/month revenue where lower processing fees offset software cost

## Contract Flexibility Ranking

### No Contracts (Month-to-Month)
1. ✅ **Square** - Cancel anytime
2. ✅ **Shopify POS** - Cancel anytime
3. ✅ **Lightspeed** - Cancel anytime
4. ✅ **Square Appointments** - Cancel anytime
5. ✅ **Vagaro** - Cancel anytime
6. ✅ **SumUp / Zettle** - No subscription at all

### Often Requires Contracts
1. ⚠️ **Toast** - Typically 24-month commitment
2. ⚠️ **Clover** - Often 36-month via resellers
3. ⚠️ **TouchBistro** - Varies, check with sales
4. ⚠️ **NCR Aloha** - Enterprise contracts

**Recommendation:** If you value flexibility or are testing the market, prioritize no-contract options (Square, Shopify, Lightspeed)

---

## Hardware Lock-In Ranking

### Flexible (Works with Standard Devices)
1. ✅ **Square** - Use smartphone/tablet, or purchase Square hardware
2. ✅ **Lightspeed** - Works with standard iPads or Android tablets
3. ✅ **TouchBistro** - Works with standard iPads
4. ✅ **Shopify POS** - Works with various devices

### Proprietary Hardware Required
1. ❌ **Toast** - Must use Toast-branded hardware (expensive, iPad-based but Toast-specific)
2. ❌ **Clover** - Must use Clover devices ($749-$1,799)
3. ❌ **NCR** - Proprietary terminals

**Recommendation:** Flexible hardware reduces switching costs. If you might change POS later, avoid proprietary hardware lock-in.

---

## Payment Processing Lock-In Ranking

### Locked to Provider's Processor
1. ❌ **Square** - Must use Square Payments (2.6% + 10¢)
2. ❌ **Toast** - Must use Toast Payments (2.49-3.69%)
3. ❌ **Shopify POS** - Effectively locked to Shopify Payments (2% surcharge for third-party)

### Flexible Processor Choice
1. ✅ **TouchBistro** - Choose from partner processors
2. ✅ **Lightspeed** - Can bring your own (may incur extra fees)
3. ✅ **Clover** - Sold via processor resellers, some flexibility

**Trade-off:** Locked processing simplifies setup but limits rate shopping. High-volume businesses should negotiate custom rates or choose flexible options.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Choosing Based on Lowest Monthly Fee Only
**Problem:** Free software often has higher processing fees
**Solution:** Calculate total cost (software + processing at your expected volume)

### Mistake #2: Not Testing During Free Trial
**Problem:** Commit without testing in real environment
**Solution:** Use free trial, process real transactions, train staff, evaluate usability

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Contract Terms
**Problem:** Discover 24-month commitment and $500 early termination fee after signing
**Solution:** Read contract carefully, ask about termination fees, understand commitment length

### Mistake #4: Overlooking Data Export Capabilities
**Problem:** Can't easily move customer/sales data if you switch POS
**Solution:** Verify CSV export or API access before committing

### Mistake #5: Underestimating Add-On Costs
**Problem:** Base plan cheap, but necessary features require expensive add-ons
**Solution:** List ALL features you need, get quote for total cost including add-ons

### Mistake #6: Choosing General-Purpose POS for Specialized Needs
**Problem:** Using Square for full-service restaurant (lacks advanced features)
**Solution:** Match POS to business type (Toast for restaurants, Lightspeed for inventory-heavy retail)
