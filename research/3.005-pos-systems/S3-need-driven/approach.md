# S3-Need-Driven: Approach

## Methodology

The **S3-Need-Driven** approach provides prescriptive, use-case specific recommendations. Instead of comparing all features across all platforms, S3 starts with your specific business scenario and recommends the optimal POS solution.

## Research Strategy

### 1. Use-Case Definition
Identify distinct business scenarios with unique POS requirements:

**Restaurant Scenarios:**
- Quick-service restaurant (QSR) / Fast-casual
- Full-service restaurant (table service)
- Bar / Brewery / Wine bar
- Food truck / Mobile food service
- Multi-location restaurant group

**Retail Scenarios:**
- General retail (single location)
- Fashion / Apparel retail
- Specialty retail (high SKU count)
- Multi-location retail chain
- E-commerce + retail hybrid (omnichannel)

**Service Scenarios:**
- Solo practitioner (hairstylist, therapist, consultant)
- Salon / Spa (small team, 2-10 staff)
- Fitness studio / Gym
- Wellness center (multi-practitioner)

**Other Scenarios:**
- Mobile merchant / Pop-up shop
- Seasonal business (farmers market, craft fair)
- Low-volume / Side business

### 2. Scenario Analysis Framework

For each use case, document:

**Business Characteristics:**
- Typical transaction volume (daily/monthly)
- Average transaction value
- Number of locations
- Number of employees
- Seasonality factors
- Growth trajectory

**Critical POS Requirements:**
- Must-have features (dealbreakers if missing)
- Important features (strong preference)
- Nice-to-have features (not critical)

**Constraints:**
- Budget limitations (software + hardware)
- Technical expertise (simple vs complex acceptable)
- Time to deployment (need it fast vs can wait)
- Contract tolerance (need flexibility vs can commit)

**Success Criteria:**
- What does the ideal POS enable?
- What problems must it solve?
- How is success measured?

### 3. Recommendation Methodology

For each scenario, provide:

**Primary Recommendation:**
- Best overall fit for 80% of businesses in this scenario
- Rationale (why this choice)
- Expected costs (realistic TCO)
- Implementation timeline
- Key strengths for this use case

**Alternative Recommendations:**
- 2-3 viable alternatives
- When to choose each alternative
- Trade-offs vs primary recommendation

**Avoid These Options:**
- Platforms that are poor fits for this scenario
- Why they don't work well
- Common mistakes businesses make

### 4. Decision Trees

Provide branching logic:

```
If [business characteristic] → Choose [Platform A]
Unless [constraint] → Then choose [Platform B]
If also [additional requirement] → Upgrade to [Higher Tier]
```
