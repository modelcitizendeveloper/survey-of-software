# Things 3 - S1 Provider Profile

## Overview

Things 3 is a premium task management application developed by Cultured Code, designed around principles from the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology. Launched in 2007 with a major redesign in 2017 (Things 3), it's known for its elegant design and Apple ecosystem integration.

**Platform:** Apple Ecosystem Only (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Apple Watch)
**Primary Market:** Individual professionals (freelancers, designers, writers)
**GTD Support:** Strong - built with GTD principles, though not officially certified

## GTD Methodology Support

### GTD-Aligned Lists

Things 3 implements GTD concepts with its own terminology:

- **Inbox:** Capture location for new tasks (GTD: Inbox)
- **Today:** Tasks to start before day ends (GTD: Next Actions for today)
- **Upcoming:** Timeline view with scheduled tasks and deadlines (GTD: Calendar + Tickler)
- **Anytime:** Tasks that could be started anytime (GTD: Next Actions)
- **Someday:** Future possibilities (GTD: Someday/Maybe)

### Unique GTD Advantage

**Distinction Between Due Dates and "Do Dates":**

Things 3 is one of the few task tools that distinguishes between:
- **When (Do Date):** When you plan to START working on something
- **Deadline (Due Date):** When something must be FINISHED

This separation aligns perfectly with GTD's emphasis on next actions vs. hard deadlines.

### Organization Structure

- **Areas:** Broader responsibility categories (Work, Personal, etc.)
- **Tags:** Flexible contexts, energy levels, time requirements
- **Headings:** Sub-organization within projects

## GTD Implementation Verdict

**Rating: Excellent (9/10)**

Things 3 is one of the best GTD implementations available, particularly for Apple users. The distinction between "when" and "deadline" dates is a standout feature that few competitors offer. The clean interface makes GTD approachable without sacrificing power.

The lack of official GTD certification doesn't diminish its effectiveness - the structure (Inbox, Anytime, Upcoming, Someday) maps cleanly to GTD concepts. Tags handle contexts, Areas handle areas of responsibility, and Projects provide clear outcomes.

**Best For:**
- Apple ecosystem users (Mac + iPhone/iPad)
- Users preferring one-time purchase over subscription
- Privacy-conscious users wanting local-first storage
- Professionals valuing clean, distraction-free design
- Solo practitioners (not teams)
- Users wanting offline-first capability

**Not Ideal For:**
- Cross-platform users or non-Apple users
- Teams or collaborative work
- Users needing AI assistance
- Users wanting web access
- Budget-conscious users ($80 upfront vs $48/year Todoist Pro)
- Users needing extensive integrations

## Competitive Position

Things 3 occupies a premium position in the personal productivity space:

- **vs Todoist:** More expensive upfront, but no ongoing cost; Apple-only vs cross-platform; more polished design
- **vs OmniFocus:** Simpler, more approachable; less powerful but easier to learn; better value
- **vs Notion:** Focused tool vs all-in-one platform; better task management, worse for notes/databases
- **vs Obsidian:** Proprietary vs open; better task UX, worse for knowledge management

**Target User:** Professional Apple user willing to pay premium for elegant, focused GTD tool without subscription burden.
