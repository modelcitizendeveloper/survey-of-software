**Platform:** Cross-platform (Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux)
**Primary Market:** Individual users and teams
**GTD Support:** Native - designed with GTD principles

## GTD Methodology Support

### Five-Step GTD Workflow

Todoist supports the complete GTD workflow:

1. **Capture:** Quick inbox for capturing tasks that come to mind
2. **Clarify:** Natural language processing for task entry (e.g., "send invoice on May 3" or "water the plants every 4 days starting June 20 ending Sept 30")
3. **Organize:** Combination of projects and labels for organization
4. **Reflect:** Filters and views for review
5. **Engage:** Priority levels and due dates for execution

### GTD-Specific Features

- **Inbox:** Central capture location for all incoming tasks
- **Projects:** Organize tasks by outcome/project
- **Labels:** Context-based organization (GTD contexts like @home, @computer, @phone)
- **Filters:** Create custom views for different GTD lists (Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe)
- **Natural Language:** Quick task entry with dates and recurrence
- **Recurring Tasks:** Full support for recurring actions

### Limitations

The David Allen Company (official GTD) recommends Pro or Business versions to get full GTD functionality. The Free version has significant limitations:

## GTD Implementation Verdict

**Rating: Excellent (9/10)**

Todoist is one of the strongest GTD implementations available. With official endorsement from the David Allen Company and a setup guide specifically for GTD, it's purpose-built for the methodology. The combination of projects, labels, and filters provides all the structure needed for a complete GTD system.

The main barrier is the limited free tier - serious GTD users will need the Pro plan ($4/month). The 2025 AI features add intelligent assistance without compromising the core GTD workflow.

**Best For:**
- GTD practitioners seeking official, well-supported implementation
- Cross-platform users who need access everywhere
- Users who value speed (natural language processing)
- Budget-conscious users ($4/month is competitive)

**Not Ideal For:**
- Users unwilling to pay for Pro tier
- Teams needing advanced project management features
- Users preferring visual/Kanban-style interfaces
- Users wanting local-first/offline-first tool
