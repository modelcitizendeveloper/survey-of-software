# Obsidian - S1 Provider Profile (Personal Productivity Use)

## Overview

Obsidian is a powerful, local-first knowledge management application built on markdown files. While primarily designed for note-taking and personal knowledge management (PKM), it has become popular for task management and GTD through its extensive plugin ecosystem.

**Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android)
**Primary Market:** Knowledge workers, researchers, writers, developers
**GTD Support:** Plugin-Based - highly customizable through community plugins

## GTD Methodology Support

### Plugin-Driven GTD Implementation

Obsidian doesn't include native GTD features, but supports GTD through plugins:

**Core Task Plugins:**

1. **Tasks Plugin** (most popular)
   - Enhances markdown checkboxes with dates, tags, scheduling
   - Start dates, due dates, recurrence
   - Query tasks across entire vault
   - Filter and display tasks in custom views

2. **OTD (Obsidian-GTD-plugin)**
   - Aggregates outstanding TODOs by type
   - Categories: Inbox, Overdue, Today, Scheduled, Context Actions, Someday/Maybe
   - Automated organization

3. **Dataview**
   - Query language for notes and tasks
   - Create dynamic task lists
   - Most powerful but requires learning syntax

**GTD System Examples:**

Multiple community-created GTD frameworks exist:
- Ready-to-go GTD vaults with task sequencing, quick-add templates, waiting-on, someday/maybe
- Custom task boards (similar to GitHub Projects)
- Various interpretations of GTD workflow

### GTD Features via Plugins

## GTD Implementation Verdict

**Rating: Powerful but Requires Expertise (7.5/10)**

Obsidian is an **excellent choice for GTD practitioners who prioritize:**
- Owning their data (local markdown files)
- Combining tasks with knowledge management
- Customization and extensibility
- Privacy and offline capability
- No recurring costs

However, it's a **poor choice for those wanting:**
- Plug-and-play GTD experience
- Simple, focused task management
- Quick task capture without friction
- Ready-made GTD without setup

**The Obsidian GTD User:** Someone who enjoys building and customizing systems, values data ownership, and wants tasks integrated with notes/knowledge base.

**Best For:**
- Knowledge workers who take extensive notes
- Users who want tasks + reference material unified
- Privacy-conscious users preferring local-first storage
- Developers/technical users comfortable with plugins and markdown
- Those who enjoy customizing their productivity system
- Cross-platform users (works everywhere)
- Budget users (completely free except optional $8/month sync)
- Users who value data ownership and portability

**Not Ideal For:**
- GTD beginners wanting quick-start experience
- Users who need speed and simplicity
- Non-technical users uncomfortable with plugins/configuration
- Those preferring polished, purpose-built task apps
- People wanting AI assistance or smart features
- Users who need natural language task entry
- Those who dislike maintenance and tinkering

## Competitive Position

Obsidian occupies a unique position as an **open, extensible knowledge management tool** that happens to support GTD:

- **vs Todoist:** More flexible but requires setup; free vs $4/month; knowledge + tasks vs tasks only
- **vs Things 3:** Open vs closed; requires more work but more customizable; free vs $80
- **vs Notion:** Local-first vs cloud; plain text vs proprietary; better privacy, less collaboration
- **vs OmniFocus:** Simpler and free but less powerful for pure GTD; better for hybrid workflows

**Primary Use Case:** Personal knowledge management with GTD task tracking as secondary benefit.

**Target User:** Technical knowledge worker who wants markdown-based, privacy-focused system for notes AND tasks, willing to invest time building their perfect GTD implementation.

**Market Position:** Open alternative to Notion for users who prioritize data ownership, privacy, and plain text over collaboration and polish.

## GTD Implementation Recommendations

If using Obsidian for GTD:

1. **Start with Tasks plugin:** Most popular and well-maintained
2. **Learn Dataview basics:** Essential for powerful task queries
3. **Use community GTD vault:** Don't build from scratch - adapt existing
4. **Daily notes workflow:** Template-based daily planning
5. **Tag for contexts:** @home, @computer, @phone, @errands
6. **Separate inbox note:** Central capture location
7. **Weekly review template:** Structured review process
8. **Keep it simple initially:** Add complexity gradually

**Time Investment:** Expect 8-12 hours to learn plugins, set up GTD structure, and customize to your workflow.

**Plugin Stack for GTD:**
- Tasks (task management)
- Dataview (queries)
- Calendar (daily notes)
- Templater (capture templates)
- Optional: Kanban, Projects, Rollover Daily Todos

**Data Philosophy:** If "my productivity data should outlive any app" resonates with you, Obsidian is ideal. Plain markdown files ensure your GTD system is portable forever.
