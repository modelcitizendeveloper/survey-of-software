  What are the leading state management libraries for React and Vue in 2025?
  How do they compare in terms of API complexity, bundle size, performance, and ecosystem?

key_findings:
  - finding: "Zustand dominates React state management with 56K stars and 15M weekly downloads"
    implication: "Default choice for most React projects in 2025"

  - finding: "Recoil archived by Facebook on Jan 1, 2025"
    implication: "Migrate away from Recoil to Jotai or Zustand"

  - finding: "Redux Toolkit still leads enterprise adoption despite lower downloads than Zustand"
    implication: "Established teams stay with Redux; new projects often choose Zustand"

  - finding: "Pinia is official Vue state management, replacing Vuex"
    implication: "No competition in Vue ecosystem - use Pinia"

  - finding: "TanStack Store emerging as signal-based alternative"
    implication: "Watch for adoption growth, especially in TanStack ecosystem"
