- **Operations prioritizing speed** (fast inventory counts critical)

- **Net ROI**: $11,100/year or 463% return

**Labor Optimization** (unique to Craftable):
- Labor integration enables 1-3% labor cost reduction

## Unique Positioning

**Profit Management vs. Inventory Management**: Craftable positions as holistic profit tool, not just inventory tracker

**Specialization**: Three products (Bevager, Foodager, House) vs. one-size-fits-all

**Speed Focus**: 30-45 min inventory counts as competitive advantage

**Labor Integration**: Unique feature combining inventory + labor + sales

## Competitive Position

**vs. xtraCHEF**: More holistic (labor + sales), less invoice automation focus
**vs. WISK**: More restaurant-focused, WISK more bar-focused
**vs. Open source**: Managed SaaS, faster setup, 1,000+ POS integrations
