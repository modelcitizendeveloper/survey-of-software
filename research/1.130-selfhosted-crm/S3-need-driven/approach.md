# S3: Need-Driven Scenarios Approach
**Time Budget**: 10-15 minutes
**Goal**: Generic deployment patterns for different business contexts

---

## Methodology

Create reusable scenario templates matching deployment model to business context:

### 1. Scenario Structure (per pattern)
- **Business context**: Team size, technical capability, budget constraints
- **Recommended platform + deployment**: Which open source CRM and how to deploy it
- **Rationale**: Why this combination fits the context
- **TCO estimate**: 3-year total cost
- **Migration triggers**: When to reevaluate
- **Applies to**: Generic business types (NOT specific clients)

### 2. Four Generic Scenarios
1. **Technical Startup**: Control & customization priority
2. **Cost-Conscious Business**: Minimal budget, growing from managed CRM
3. **Simple Self-Hosting**: Non-technical team, basic DevOps capability
4. **Enterprise Independence**: Large scale, strategic control

## Output

**Deliverables**: 4 scenario markdown files showing deployment model selection for different contexts

**Time Budget**: 10-15 minutes total
