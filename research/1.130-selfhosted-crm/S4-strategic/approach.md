# S4: Strategic Viability Approach
**Time Budget**: 20 minutes
**Goal**: Lock-in analysis, platform viability, long-term trade-offs vs proprietary SaaS

---

## Methodology

Strategic assessment of open source CRM platforms across three dimensions:

### 1. Lock-in Spectrum Analysis (8 min)
- Pure self-hosted (zero lock-in)
- Managed open source (low lock-in) - the key distinction
- Proprietary SaaS (medium-to-very-high lock-in) - reference from 3.501
- Migration complexity and costs between models
- Optionality value (ability to switch)

### 2. Platform Viability Assessment (6 min)
- Company/foundation stability
- Development activity and roadmap
- Community size and health
- Commercial ecosystem (consultants, support)
- 5-10 year outlook
- Acquisition/discontinuation risk

### 3. Long-Term Strategic Trade-offs (6 min)
- Self-hosted vs managed open source vs proprietary
- When lock-in is acceptable (and when it's not)
- Total cost of ownership over 5-10 years
- Strategic control vs convenience
- "Tier 1 will eat Tier 3 for lunch" thesis validation
