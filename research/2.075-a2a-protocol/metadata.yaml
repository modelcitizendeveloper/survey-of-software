summary: |
  Open protocol for agent-to-agent communication, enabling AI agents from
  different vendors to discover, negotiate, and collaborate. Complements MCP
  (agent↔tool) with horizontal integration (agent↔agent).

key_findings:
  - "A2A = agent↔agent, MCP = agent↔tool (complementary, not competing)"
  - "Task-based model with lifecycle (submitted→working→completed)"
  - "Agent Cards for capability discovery (/.well-known/agent.json)"
  - "JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S), with SSE streaming and webhook push"
  - "150+ organizations adopted, Linux Foundation governance"
  - "Python SDK: pip install a2a-sdk"

smcp_relevance:
  overlap:
    - "Paulina (Registry) ↔ Agent Cards - similar discovery"
    - "Roshumba (Router) ↔ A2A Client - could use A2A for inter-MCP"
  no_overlap:
    - "Kathy (Config) - no A2A equivalent"
    - "Gail (Logger) - no A2A equivalent"
    - "Naomi (Event Bus) - A2A webhooks weaker than full pub/sub"
    - "Judith (Workflows) - no A2A equivalent"
    - "Stacey (Orchestrator) - no A2A equivalent"
  recommendation: |
    Hybrid approach: Unix sockets for internal SMCP communication (fast),
    A2A gateway for external agent interoperability.
