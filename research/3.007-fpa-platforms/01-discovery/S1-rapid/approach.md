# S1 Rapid Discovery - Approach

**Experiment**: 3.007 FP&A Platforms
**Stage**: S1 - Rapid Discovery
**Date**: November 1, 2025

---

## Methodology

**Goal**: Establish baseline understanding of FP&A platform landscape through quick provider assessments.

**Scope**: 8 platforms across 3 market tiers (Startup, Mid-Market, Enterprise)

**Time Investment**: 30-60 minutes per platform (4-8 hours total)

**Output**: Individual platform profiles (~500 lines each) capturing:
- Company overview, founding, funding, scale
- Core modules and capabilities
- Target market (company size, industry, use cases)
- Pricing model and cost structure
- Key differentiators
- Notable customers
- Integration capabilities
- Platform strengths and limitations

## Platform Selection Criteria

**Tier 1: Startup FP&A** ($3K-30K/year)
- Target: 20-500 employees
- Setup: 1-4 weeks
- Use case: Headcount planning, department budgets, scenario modeling

**Tier 2: Mid-Market** ($15K-100K/year)
- Target: 250-2000 employees
- Setup: 1-3 months
- Use case: Driver-based planning, workforce planning, consolidation

**Tier 3: Enterprise CPM** ($50K-500K/year)
- Target: 2000+ employees
- Setup: 3-12 months
- Use case: Connected planning, complex consolidation, predictive analytics

## Data Sources

**Primary Sources**:
- Platform websites (public marketing, pricing pages where available)
- Technical documentation (API docs, integration guides)
- Platform blog posts, case studies, product announcements
- Integration marketplace data
- Recent funding announcements, acquisition news

**Secondary Sources**:
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
- User review aggregates (G2, Capterra - public summary data only)
- Procurement benchmarking (Vendr, TrustRadius)

**Limitations**:
- Pricing: 7 of 8 platforms do not publish transparent pricing (custom quotes)
- Customer counts: Not all platforms disclose
- Implementation costs: Estimates based on industry benchmarks
- Churn rates: Not publicly available

---

## Research Philosophy

**Hardware Store Principle**: Generic catalog content applicable to any buyer context. No client-specific recommendations or "Choose X if..." prescriptive guidance in S1.

**Factual Focus**: Document what platforms provide, not which to choose.

**Integration Emphasis**: Capture HRIS, accounting, ERP, data warehouse integration capabilities (critical for FP&A platform value).

**Cost Transparency**: Document pricing where available, estimate TCO where not published.
