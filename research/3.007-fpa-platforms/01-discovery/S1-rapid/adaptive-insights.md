---

## 8. Platform Limitations

### ❌ Workday Lock-In (Advantage Lost Without Workday)
Primary differentiation = Workday integration. If not using Workday HCM/Financials, advantage lost.

### ❌ Expensive ($150K-1M+ Total 3-Year)
Enterprise pricing. Not affordable for SMB (<500 employees) or budget-constrained organizations.

### ❌ Long Implementation (8-16 Weeks)
Requires professional services. Not self-service. Complex Workday integrations add time.

### ❌ Pricing Opacity (No Published Pricing)
100% custom quotes. Cannot self-evaluate budget fit. 4-12 week sales cycle.

### ❌ Not Startup-Friendly
Too expensive, too complex for Series A-C startups. No Rippling/Gusto HRIS integration.

### ❌ Enterprise Focus Limits Innovation Speed
Large organization, slower feature velocity than VC-backed startups (Runway, Causal).

### ❌ Training Required (Not Consumer-Grade UX)
Enterprise-grade complexity. Requires admin training, user onboarding. Steep learning curve.
