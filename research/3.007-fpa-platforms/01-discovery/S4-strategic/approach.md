# S4 Strategic Discovery - Approach

**Experiment**: 3.007 FP&A Platforms
**Stage**: S4 - Strategic Discovery
**Date**: November 1, 2025

---

## Methodology

**Goal**: Strategic frameworks for long-term FP&A platform decisions - graduation triggers, build-vs-buy economics, vendor viability, and ecosystem dynamics.

**Scope**: Forward-looking analysis (3-5 year outlook), vendor risk assessment, technology evolution predictions.

**Time Investment**: 3-5 days

## S4 Deliverables

### 1. Graduation Frameworks
**File**: `graduation-frameworks.md`

**Coverage**:
- **Excel → FP&A Platform**: When does Excel break? (employee count, model complexity, collaboration needs)
- **Cash Flow Tools (3.004) → FP&A**: When do companies outgrow Pulse/Fathom/Finmark?
- **Tier 1 → Tier 2**: Runway/Causal → Vena/Prophix/Adaptive (50-500 employees transition)
- **Tier 2 → Tier 3**: Mid-market → Enterprise CPM (consolidation complexity, global scale)
- **Quantified triggers**: Revenue thresholds, employee counts, entity counts, budget complexity

**Format**: Decision trees, quantified thresholds, upgrade/downgrade patterns

### 2. Build vs Buy Economics
**File**: `build-vs-buy.md`

**Coverage**:
- **DIY FP&A system costs**: Data warehouse modeling (dbt + Snowflake), custom dashboards (Looker/Tableau)
- **Platform costs**: Software + implementation + maintenance (3-year TCO from S2)
- **Breakeven analysis**: When does DIY TCO < platform TCO?
- **Hybrid approaches**: Platform for planning + custom for analytics
- **Custom LLM opportunities**: Build financial AI vs buy platform AI
- **Build risks**: Maintenance burden, feature gaps, lack of collaboration tools

**Format**: TCO comparison tables, breakeven calculations, risk assessment

---

### 3. Vendor Viability
**File**: `vendor-viability.md`

**Coverage**:
- **Financial health**: Public companies (OneStream IPO), PE-owned (Planful, Anaplan), VC-backed (Runway, Vena)
- **Acquisition predictions**: 5-year M&A likelihood, potential acquirers
- **Platform longevity**: 10-year survival probability
- **Roadmap stability**: Public company (predictable) vs startup (pivot risk)
- **Customer base growth**: Platform momentum indicators
- **⭐ 5-Year AI Evolution Outlook**: What AI features will commoditize? What remains differentiated? When to buy platform for AI vs build custom?

**Format**: Viability scoring matrix, acquisition probability, AI timeline predictions

---

### 4. Integration Ecosystem Analysis
**File**: `integration-ecosystem.md`

**Coverage**:
- **HRIS partnerships**: Why Runway-Rippling pairing dominates SMB? Why Adaptive-Workday enterprise?
- **ERP partnerships**: Planful-NetSuite (600+ customers), Prophix-Microsoft Dynamics
- **Data warehouse trends**: Rise of data-warehouse-native FP&A (Causal model)
- **Integration middleware**: Finch (HRIS aggregator), Merge.dev, Zapier for FP&A
- **Ecosystem lock-in**: Integration quality creating switching costs
- **Future integration patterns**: 2025-2030 predictions (API standardization, real-time sync)

**Format**: Partnership analysis, ecosystem maps, future trends

---

### 5. Synthesis
**File**: `synthesis.md`

**Coverage**:
- Strategic decision frameworks (when to graduate, build vs buy)
- Long-term platform selection criteria (10-year view)
- Vendor risk mitigation strategies
- Technology evolution predictions (AI, integrations, pricing)
- Meta-insights from S1-S4 research

**Format**: Strategic summary, actionable frameworks

---

## Research Philosophy

**Forward-Looking**: S1-S3 = current state catalog/scenarios. S4 = future state predictions.

**Risk Assessment**: Vendor viability, acquisition predictions, technology commoditization.

**Hardware Store Principle**: Generic frameworks applicable to any company context (not client-specific).

**AI Focus**: 5-year AI outlook required per MPSE v3.0 for Tier 3 experiments.

---

## Next Steps After S4

**Research Complete**: S1-S4 comprehensive FP&A platform analysis
**Client Application**: Apply catalog + frameworks to specific company contexts (billable consulting)
**Roadmap Update**: Document completion in 3.007 metadata, update spawn-solutions roadmap
