# S2 Comprehensive Discovery - Approach

**Experiment**: 3.007 FP&A Platforms
**Stage**: S2 - Comprehensive Discovery
**Date**: November 1, 2025

---

## Methodology

**Goal**: Deep feature comparison, detailed integration analysis, comprehensive pricing/TCO, and AI capabilities evaluation across 8 FP&A platforms.

**Scope**: Build on S1 rapid discovery with detailed matrices and quantified comparisons.

**Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks (detailed research, cross-platform comparison matrices)

## S2 Deliverables

### 1. Feature Matrix
**File**: `feature-matrix.md`

**Coverage**:
- Workforce planning capabilities (org charts, compensation, benefits, ramp-to-productivity)
- Financial consolidation depth (multi-entity, multi-currency, multi-GAAP, intercompany eliminations)
- Planning capabilities (driver-based, top-down/bottom-up, zero-based budgeting)
- Reporting & dashboards (pre-built templates, custom reports, drill-down, exports)
- Workflow & approvals (multi-level routing, audit trails, version control)
- Scenario modeling (unlimited scenarios, sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo)
- Capital planning (CapEx budgeting, depreciation, ROI analysis)

**Format**: Comparison table (8 platforms × 50+ features)

---

### 2. Integrations Deep Dive
**File**: `integrations-deep-dive.md`

**Coverage**:
- HRIS integration architecture (Rippling, Gusto, BambooHR, Workday, ADP, Oracle HCM)
- ERP integration quality (NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, Sage Intacct)
- Data warehouse integration (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks)
- CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Integration methods (native, API, ETL, iPaaS)
- Setup complexity (1-click vs custom development)
- Data sync frequency (real-time, hourly, daily, batch)

**Format**: Integration matrix + architecture diagrams

---

### 3. Pricing & TCO Analysis
**File**: `pricing-tco.md`

**Coverage**:
- Per-module pricing breakdowns
- User license types and costs (admin, contributor, viewer)
- Implementation fees by complexity level
- Annual contract requirements
- Hidden costs (training, ongoing consulting, support tiers, integrations)
- 3-year TCO detailed calculations
- 5-year TCO projections
- Cost per employee analysis

**Format**: Detailed pricing tables, TCO scenarios

---

### 4. Implementation Complexity
**File**: `implementation-complexity.md`

**Coverage**:
- Setup timeline by platform (weeks to months)
- Required vs optional consulting
- Self-service capability assessment
- Data migration complexity
- Integration configuration effort
- Training requirements (admin, power user, end user)
- Change management challenges
- Time to first value

**Format**: Implementation comparison matrix, timeline charts

---

### 5. AI Capabilities Coverage
**File**: `ai-capabilities-coverage.md`

**Coverage**:
- AI feature inventory (all 8 platforms)
- AI maturity assessment (production vs beta vs vaporware)
- Hype vs reality evaluation
- Custom LLM opportunities (Path A/B/C analysis)
- AI ROI validation (customer feedback, time savings)
- 2025-2030 AI evolution predictions
- When to build custom AI vs buy platform AI

**Format**: AI maturity matrix, Path A/B/C decision tree

---

### 6. Synthesis
**File**: `synthesis.md`

**Coverage**:
- Cross-cutting insights from all S2 analyses
- Feature gaps and overlaps
- Integration ecosystem patterns
- Pricing strategy patterns
- Total addressable market by platform
- Competitive positioning refined

**Format**: Narrative synthesis with key takeaways

---

## Research Philosophy

**Hardware Store Principle**: Continue generic catalog content. No client-specific recommendations in S2.

**Quantified Comparisons**: Use matrices, tables, and charts for objective comparison (not subjective "best").

**Data Lineage**: Track all pricing estimates, feature claims to sources (platform docs, user reviews, industry reports).

**Integration Focus**: Deep dive on HRIS/ERP integration quality (S1 finding: integration = deal-breaker).

---

## Next Steps After S2

**S3 Need-Driven**: Apply S2 feature/integration matrices to 5 generic business scenarios
**S4 Strategic**: Vendor viability analysis, graduation frameworks, build-vs-buy economics
