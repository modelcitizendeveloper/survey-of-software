rationale: |
  MEDIUM PRIORITY - Language-learning app translation needs (Latin ↔ English, Japanese ↔ English).
  Translation (text → text) separate from transcription (audio → text).
  Split from 3.202 multilingual scenario - bidirectional translation for vocabulary drills.

platforms_evaluated:
  traditional_apis:
    - Google Cloud Translation (100+ languages, $15/M, 500K free tier ongoing)
    - DeepL (30+ languages, $25/M, European quality premium)
    - Amazon Translate (75 languages, $15/M, AWS integration)
  llm_based:
    - Claude 3.5 (Haiku $4.80/M, Sonnet $18/M, best Asian languages, pedagogical)
    - GPT-4o ($12.50/M, Korean advantage, widespread adoption)
    - Gemini (Flash $0.375/M, Pro $6.25/M, cheapest LLM option)

key_findings:
  - No universal winner (depends on languages, volume, pedagogy needs)
  - Hybrid approach optimal (traditional APIs for bulk, LLMs for pedagogy)
  - Claude 3.5 Haiku best value ($4.80/M, 68% cheaper than Google, pedagogical)
  - Gemini Flash game-changer ($0.375/M, 97.5% cheaper than Google, LLM quality)
  - Google Translate permanent free tier (500K/month) best for small apps
  - DeepL quality premium (67% more expensive) only justified for European business docs
  - Translation costs <2.5% of revenue (negligible at any scale)
  - Pedagogical features essential (grammar explanations, cultural context, error correction)
  - LLMs required for language learning (traditional APIs insufficient)
  - Latin support: Google + LLMs only (DeepL/Amazon don't support)

recommended_platforms:
  latin_learning: "Google Translate (bulk) + Claude 3.5 Haiku (pedagogical)"
  japanese_learning: "Claude 3.5 Haiku (best Japanese quality, WMT24 winner)"
  european_languages: "DeepL (quality premium) or Claude 3.5 Haiku (81% cheaper)"
  multi_language: "Google Translate (100+ languages) + Claude 3.5 Haiku (pedagogy)"
  high_volume_bulk: "Google Translate (simple vocabulary lookup)"
  budget_constrained: "Gemini Flash ($0.375/M, LLM quality, 97.5% cheaper)"

next_steps:
  s2_comprehensive:
    - Feature matrix (50+ features × 7 platforms)
    - Pricing TCO (6 volume scenarios: 1K to 10M translations/month)
    - Quality benchmarks (BLEU scores, WMT competition results, human evaluation)
    - Integration complexity (time-to-first-translation, code examples)
  s3_need_driven:
    - 6 use case scenarios (Latin learning, Japanese learning, European learning, multi-language, high-volume, budget-constrained)
    - Architecture patterns (hybrid traditional+LLM, LLM-only, budget-optimized)
    - Implementation guides (code examples, prompt engineering)
  s4_strategic:
    - Vendor viability (10-year survival probability)
    - Lock-in mitigation strategies (API compatibility, switching costs)
    - Technology evolution (2025-2030 LLM trajectory, traditional API convergence)
    - Build vs buy decision framework
