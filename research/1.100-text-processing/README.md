# 1.100-text-processing: Text Data Processing Library Discovery

## Experiment Classification
- **Tier**: 1 (Library/Package Discovery)
- **Category**: 1.100-199 (Data processing libraries)
- **Domain**: Text data processing and analysis

## Research Question
**"What are the optimal libraries for text data processing from raw text to production applications?"**

## Scope
Text processing pipeline from raw input to applications:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction and vectorization
- Classification and analysis
- Production integration patterns

## Experiment Structure

### 01-discovery/
**MPSE S1-S4 methodology results**
- Library candidates discovered: FastText, scikit-learn, spaCy, NLTK, transformers
- Convergence analysis between methodologies
- Selection rationale and trade-off analysis

### 02-implementations/
**Library × Method × Model implementation matrix**
- FastText implementations (4 methodologies × 5 models)
- scikit-learn implementations (4 methodologies × 5 models)
- Cross-library performance comparison
- Model capability assessment for text processing

### 03-applications/
**Practical applications using discovered libraries**
- Text processor (cleaning, extraction, sentiment)
- Config generator (template-based text generation)
- Data transformer (text format conversions)
- Real-world usage patterns and integration

### 04-solutions/
**Production-ready text processing toolkit**
- Optimized implementations based on 02/ findings
- Integration patterns for spawn-experiments methodology
- Documentation and deployment guides
- Performance benchmarks and recommendations

## Research Dividend
**Before**: Heard of text processing libraries but unclear how to use them effectively
**After**: Working text processing applications with clear library selection rationale and production integration patterns

## Integration with spawn-experiments
This experiment provides:
1. **Library expertise**: Which text processing library for which use case
2. **Working patterns**: Proven implementation approaches
3. **Production pathways**: Ready for spawn-experiments methodology optimization

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Library selection criteria** for text processing tasks
2. **Implementation patterns** that work with different model capabilities
3. **Application templates** for common text processing needs
4. **Production integration** guidance for discovered libraries
