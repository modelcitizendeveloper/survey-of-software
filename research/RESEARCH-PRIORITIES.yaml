# Research Priorities Queue
#
# Purpose: Maintain ordered list of next experiments to research
# Usage: Agents check this file first for "what to research next"
# Management: Add new items to bottom, reorder as priorities shift
# Cadence: ~1 experiment per day = 7 items = 1 week's work

queue:
  # Week 1: Complete in-progress + high-value next items

# Instructions for agents:
# 1. Read this file to get next research item
# 2. Take first item in queue
# 3. If item has dependencies, check they're completed first
# 4. After completing research, remove from this queue
# 5. Regenerate COMPLETED-RESEARCH.yaml and PLANNED-RESEARCH.yaml

# Instructions for humans:
# - Add new items to bottom of queue (or insert at priority position)
# - Reorder queue as client needs emerge
# - Mark status: not_started | in_progress | blocked
# - Update estimated_hours based on actual completion times
