  estimated_hours: 6-8
  rationale: |
    MEDIUM PRIORITY - Language-learning app speaking practice ("How's my accent?").
    AI scores pronunciation accuracy, provides phoneme-level feedback.
    Unique value-add (most language apps lack good pronunciation feedback).

  title: Translation & Localization Services
  tier: 3
  status: not_started
  estimated_hours: 6-8
  rationale: |
    MEDIUM PRIORITY - Split from 3.202 multilingual scenario.
    Translation (text → text) is separate from transcription (audio → text).
    Language-learning app needs bidirectional translation (Latin ↔ English, Japanese ↔ English).
  value: |
    Platform comparison:
    - Google Translate: 100+ languages, $20/M chars
    - DeepL: 30+ languages (European focus), $25/M chars (higher quality)
    - LLM-based (Claude, GPT-4): All major languages, $3-30/M tokens, best for context-aware
    Cost: $15-25/M characters (cheaper than human translation $0.10-0.30/word)
    ROI: Translation drills, flashcard auto-generation, semantic validation
  platforms: Google Translate, DeepL, LLM-based (Claude, GPT-4), Amazon Translate
  use_case: Translation drills, multilingual content localization, semantic equivalence validation

  title: Labor Scheduling (Restaurant-Specific)
  tier: 3
  status: not_started
  estimated_hours: 6-8
  rationale: |
    HIGH PRIORITY - Seattle restaurant cost reduction opportunity.
    Labor = 30-35% of revenue (largest controllable cost).
    Seattle minimum wage $20.76/hr (highest in US) makes optimization critical.
    5-10% labor reduction = $22K-52K/year for $1.5M revenue restaurant.
