  estimated_hours: 6-8
  rationale: |
    MEDIUM PRIORITY - Split from 3.202 multilingual scenario.
    Translation (text → text) is separate from transcription (audio → text).
    Language-learning app needs bidirectional translation (Latin ↔ English, Japanese ↔ English).
  value: |
    Platform comparison:
    - Google Translate: 100+ languages, $20/M chars
    - DeepL: 30+ languages (European focus), $25/M chars (higher quality)
    - LLM-based (Claude, GPT-4): All major languages, $3-30/M tokens, best for context-aware
    Cost: $15-25/M characters (cheaper than human translation $0.10-0.30/word)
    ROI: Translation drills, flashcard auto-generation, semantic validation
  platforms: Google Translate, DeepL, LLM-based (Claude, GPT-4), Amazon Translate
  use_case: Translation drills, multilingual content localization, semantic equivalence validation
