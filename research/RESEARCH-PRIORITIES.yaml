  title: Morphological Analysis Libraries
  tier: 1
  status: not_started
  estimated_hours: 8-12
  rationale: |
    Multi-language morphological analysis for language learning app.
    Need to handle VERY different language structures:
    - Japanese: agglutinative, particles, 3 scripts (hiragana/katakana/kanji)
    - Russian: fusional, 6 cases, perfective/imperfective aspect
    - Czech: 7 cases, complex declension patterns
    - Latin: already covered in 1.140 (CLTK)
    Critical for generating inflected forms and parsing user input.
  value: |
    Japanese libraries:
    - MeCab (classic, widely used, requires binary installation)
    - fugashi (Python wrapper for MeCab with better API)
    - SudachiPy (modern, pure Python, better for new words)
    - jamdict (JMdict dictionary, kanji lookup by reading/meaning)
    - jaconv (kana/romaji conversion)

    Slavic libraries:
    - pymorphy2 (Russian morphology, excellent coverage)
    - UDPipe (Czech, Universal Dependencies models)
    - spaCy models (hr_core_news, sr_core_news for Croatian/Serbian)
    - transliterate (Cyrillic ↔ Latin for B/S/C variants)

    Evaluation criteria:
    - Accuracy of inflection generation
    - Parsing quality (analyze inflected forms)
    - Installation complexity (binary deps vs pure Python)
    - Dictionary coverage (especially for Japanese kanji)
    - API usability for quiz generation
  libraries: MeCab, fugashi, SudachiPy, jamdict, pymorphy2, UDPipe, spaCy
  use_case: Generate and validate inflected forms across Japanese, Slavic, and Romance languages
