  status: not_started
  estimated_hours: 8-10
  rationale: |
    Specialized coverage of graph databases (deeper than 3.041 NoSQL Neo4j coverage).
    Triggered by use case: representing research project as graph (research items, relationships, dependencies).
    Goal: Evaluate graph DB options avoiding Neo4j lock-in.
  value: |
    - openCypher portability (Neo4j, Neptune, ArangoDB)
    - Gremlin vs Cypher comparison
    - Graph algorithms (PageRank, centrality, community detection)
    - Self-hosting (Neo4j Community, JanusGraph, Memgraph)
    - Cost analysis (managed vs self-hosted)
  providers: Neo4j Aura, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB, TigerGraph, Memgraph, JanusGraph, Dgraph
  use_case: Knowledge graph for research project relationships
