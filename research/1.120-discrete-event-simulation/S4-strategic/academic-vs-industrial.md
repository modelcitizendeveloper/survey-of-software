# Academic vs Industrial Adoption

## Research Findings

### Academic Origins and Adoption

**SimPy**: Academic origins (Klaus Müller, Tony Vignaux, 2002), now widely used in both academia and industry.

**Mesa**: Academic tool (NetLogo alternative for Python), primarily research use cases.
- JOSS publication
- Google Summer of Code projects
- University courses

**salabim**: Academic (JOSS 2018), smaller academic community.

**Ciw**: Academic (queueing theory research), niche tool.

**desmod**: Industrial (Western Digital), designed for corporate hardware modeling.

## Industrial Use Evidence

**SimPy**:
- DataCamp course (commercial education = industry interest)
- Real Python tutorial (mainstream adoption)
- Google Group discussions reference logistics, manufacturing companies (anecdotal)

**desmod**:
- Western Digital corporate backing (strongest industrial evidence)
- Storage systems, hardware modeling use cases

**Mesa**: Limited industrial adoption (primarily academic/research).

**salabim**: Unclear industrial adoption (smaller community, less public case studies).

**Ciw**: Academic focus (queueing theory research).

## Academic vs Industrial Priorities

| Priority | Academic | Industrial |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Publication** | High (papers, reproducibility) | Low |
| **Ease of use** | Medium | High (developer time costly) |
| **Performance** | Medium | High (large-scale simulations) |
| **Stability** | Low (cutting-edge features) | High (production use) |
| **Documentation** | Variable | High (onboarding new staff) |
| **Visualization** | High (presentations) | Medium (analysis-focused) |

## Library Positioning

**SimPy**: Crossover success (academic origins, industrial adoption)
**Mesa**: Academic tool (ABM research)
**salabim**: Academic leaning (JOSS, visualization for presentations)
**Ciw**: Academic (queueing theory research)
**desmod**: Industrial (corporate use case)

---

## Implications for Adoption

**For academic projects**: Mesa, Ciw, salabim are well-documented for research. SimPy is versatile.

**For industrial projects**: SimPy (proven) or desmod (if component-based architecture needed). Mesa/Ciw too specialized.

---

## Summary

SimPy bridges academic and industrial use. Mesa is academic. desmod is industrial. salabim and Ciw are academic-leaning but viable for industry.
