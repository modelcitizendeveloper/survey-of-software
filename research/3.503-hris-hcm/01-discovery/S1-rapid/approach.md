## Methodology

### Platform Selection Criteria

**8 Platforms Chosen** to represent the full spectrum:

**Startup/SMB Tier** (10-250 employees):
1. **Rippling** - Modern all-in-one, fast-growing
2. **Gusto** - Payroll-first, established startup favorite
3. **BambooHR** - HR-focused (no payroll), popular in SMB

**Mid-Market Tier** (250-2000 employees):
4. **Paycom** - Single database, employee self-service (Beti)
5. **ADP Workforce Now** - Established player, comprehensive
6. **Paylocity** - Modern interface, strong payroll + HR

**Enterprise Tier** (2000+ employees):
7. **Workday HCM** - Modern cloud, SaaS leader
8. **Oracle HCM Cloud** - Traditional enterprise, comprehensive

**Not Profiling** (but acknowledged):
- Justworks (PEO model - different category)
- Namely (mid-market, similar to Paylocity)
- UKG Pro (time-first, enterprise-lite)
- SAP SuccessFactors (enterprise, similar to Oracle/Workday)
- International specialists (Deel, Remote, Oyster)

## Information Sources

### Primary Sources
1. **Vendor websites** (product pages, pricing if public)
2. **G2, Capterra reviews** (user sentiment, company size data)
3. **Vendor documentation** (API docs, integration lists)
4. **Public filings** (for public companies: ADP, Workday, Paycom)
5. **Industry reports** (Gartner, Forrester if accessible)

### Secondary Sources
6. **Reddit** (r/smallbusiness, r/humanresources)
7. **LinkedIn posts** (implementation stories, migrations)
8. **YouTube demos** (product walkthroughs)
9. **Comparison sites** (vs battles, migration stories)

### Information Gathering Limits
- **No sales calls** at S1 stage (too time-consuming)
- **Publicly available pricing only** (avoid "contact us")
- **30-45 minutes per platform** (rapid, not deep)
- **Focus on facts, not marketing claims**
