## Research Methodology

### 1. Platform Selection Criteria

**Mid-Market Focus (6 platforms):**
1. **NetSuite** - Market leader, cloud-native, Oracle-backed
2. **Microsoft Dynamics 365** - Strong in mid-market, Azure integration
3. **SAP Business One** - Manufacturing-focused, strong in Europe/Asia
4. **Odoo Enterprise** - Open-source core, highly customizable
5. **Acumatica** - Modern cloud ERP, consumption pricing
6. **Oracle ERP Cloud** - Enterprise platform with mid-market reach

**Why these platforms?**
- Market share and mindshare leaders
- Different positioning (cloud-first vs hybrid, modular vs suite)
- Range of price points ($50/user/mo → $999/user/mo)
- Different philosophical approaches (proprietary vs open source)

### 2. Research Questions (Per Platform)

For each platform, answer:

**A. Platform Positioning**
- Target company size (revenue, employee count)
- Industry focus (horizontal vs vertical)
- Deployment model (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

**B. Core Capabilities**
- Financial management depth
- Supply chain & inventory features
- Manufacturing capabilities (if any)
- HR/payroll integration
- CRM module quality
- Multi-entity/multi-currency support

**C. Technical Architecture**
- Technology stack
- Customization approach (low-code, code-first, both)
- API availability and quality
- Integration ecosystem

**D. Pricing Model**
- User-based vs consumption-based
- Module pricing (all-in-one vs à la carte)
- Implementation costs (typical range)
- Hidden costs (training, support, customization)

**E. Adoption Indicators**
- Company size sweet spot
- Typical use cases
- Common migration paths (from what? to what?)
- Market perception (strengths/weaknesses)

### 3. Information Sources

**Primary Sources:**
- Official vendor websites and documentation
- Pricing pages (where public)
- G2, Gartner, Capterra reviews for real-world feedback

**Secondary Sources:**
- ERP selection guides (Software Advice, SelectHub)
- Comparison articles (NetSuite vs Dynamics, etc.)
- Reddit, HN, indie hacker discussions

**Tertiary Sources:**
- Implementation partner case studies
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP)

### 4. Time Budget

- **Platform research**: 20-30 min per platform × 6 = 2-3 hours
- **Synthesis and recommendation**: 30-60 min
- **Total**: 2.5-4 hours

### 5. Deliverables

**Per Platform:**
- `provider-[name].md` - 1-2 page profile

**Synthesis:**
- `recommendation.md` - Quick decision framework for common scenarios

## Key Comparison Dimensions

### Business Fit
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Industry (manufacturing, distribution, services, retail)
- Geographic requirements (multi-country, multi-currency)
- Growth trajectory (current state → 5 year projection)

### Functional Coverage
- **Core ERP**: Financials, inventory, procurement, order management
- **Manufacturing**: MRP, production planning, shop floor, quality
- **HR/Payroll**: Employee records, time tracking, benefits, payroll
- **CRM**: Sales pipeline, marketing automation, customer service
- **Project Management**: Time tracking, billing, resource allocation
- **Business Intelligence**: Reporting, dashboards, analytics

### Technical Fit
- Deployment preference (cloud vs on-premise vs hybrid)
- Customization needs (standard vs heavily customized)
- Integration requirements (API quality, pre-built connectors)
- IT resources (managed service vs self-managed)

### Financial Considerations
- Budget range (software + implementation + ongoing)
- Pricing model preference (user-based vs consumption vs module)
- TCO over 3-5 years
- Switching costs and lock-in

## Decision Framework Preview

**Quick scenarios for S1 recommendation:**

**Scenario 1: Small Manufacturing Company ($5M-$25M revenue)**
→ SAP Business One or Odoo Enterprise (manufacturing focus)

**Scenario 2: Fast-Growing SaaS Startup ($10M-$50M revenue)**
→ NetSuite (scalable, cloud-native, strong financials)

**Scenario 3: Mid-Market Services Firm ($25M-$100M revenue)**
→ Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Acumatica (services-oriented, flexible)

**Scenario 4: Budget-Conscious SMB with Technical Team**
→ Odoo Community (open source, self-hosted option)

**Scenario 5: Enterprise with Complex Requirements ($500M+ revenue)**
→ SAP S/4HANA or Oracle ERP Cloud (enterprise-grade, but out of scope for S1)

## Success Criteria

**S1 is complete when we can answer:**
1. ✅ Which 3-4 ERP platforms should we shortlist for mid-market companies?
2. ✅ What's the approximate cost range for each? ($X/user/mo or $XXK total)
3. ✅ What triggers ERP adoption vs staying with accounting software?
4. ✅ What are the major trade-offs between platforms?
5. ✅ Is there a "default safe choice" for most companies?

## Next Steps

1. Research 6 platforms (NetSuite, Dynamics 365, SAP B1, Odoo, Acumatica, Oracle)
2. Create comparison synthesis
3. Draft recommendation for common scenarios
4. Identify gaps for S2 deeper dive (pricing details, compliance, AI capabilities)
