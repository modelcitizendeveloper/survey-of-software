summary: |
  Python libraries for calendar sync: icalendar (parsing, 4.7M/month),
  caldav (CalDAV client, 107K/month). Recommendation: icalendar + caldav
  for Vikunja integration. vobject is legacy.

key_findings:
  - icalendar is de facto standard for RFC 5545 parsing (4.7M downloads/month)
  - caldav v2.2 adds RFC 6764 auto-discovery (Nextcloud, etc)
  - vobject is legacy - prefer icalendar unless need vCard
  - Google Calendar doesn't accept external CalDAV writes
  - Proton Calendar has no CalDAV/API support

recommendation: |
  Use icalendar + caldav for Vikunja calendar integration.
  caldav handles CalDAV protocol, icalendar handles ICS format.

next_steps:
  - Test caldav with Vikunja CalDAV endpoint
  - Benchmark icalendar parsing performance
  - Test RRULE expansion for recurring events
