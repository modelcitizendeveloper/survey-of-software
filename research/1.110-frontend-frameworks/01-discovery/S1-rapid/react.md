# S1 Rapid: React + Next.js

**Quick Snapshot**: Industry standard with largest ecosystem and hiring pool.

**Market Share**: 70% of frontend framework market

**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## Adoption Metrics

**npm downloads** (weekly, October 2025):
- react: 22M downloads/week
- next: 6M downloads/week

**GitHub**:
- react: 220K stars, 46K issues, 1,600+ contributors
- next: 118K stars, 2,500 issues, 2,800+ contributors

**Company usage**: Facebook/Meta, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, Dropbox, Asana

**Job market**: 50,000+ React job postings (Indeed, October 2025)

## Philosophy

**Core concept**: "UI as a function of state" - components are pure functions that render based on props and state.

**JSX syntax**: HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript enables declarative UI.

**Unidirectional data flow**: Data flows down through props, events flow up through callbacks.

**Meta-framework (Next.js)**: Adds SSR, SSG, file-based routing, API routes, image optimization.

## Strengths (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Largest Ecosystem
- 10,000+ component libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI)
- 50,000+ npm packages tagged "react"
- Every major tool has React bindings (charting, maps, animations)

### 2. Easiest Hiring
- 50,000+ job postings (33x more than Svelte)
- Widest talent pool (70% of frontend developers know React)
- Extensive training resources (Udemy, Frontend Masters, official docs)

### 3. Battle-Tested at Scale
- Powers Facebook (billions of users)
- Proven in production at Netflix, Airbnb, Uber
- 10+ years of maturity (released 2013)

---

## Weaknesses (S1 Perspective)

### 1. Larger Bundle Size
- 45kb baseline (vs 10kb Svelte, 15kb Solid)
- Typical app: 200-350kb (vs 50-100kb Svelte)

### 2. Lower Developer Satisfaction
- 80% satisfaction (State of JS 2024)
- 25% "would not use again" (higher than Svelte/Solid)

### 3. Complex Ecosystem
- Many ways to solve same problem (state management: Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil)
- Decision fatigue for newcomers
- Ecosystem fragmentation

## Rapid Scoring (S1 Criteria)

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Adoption** | 10/10 | 70% market share, 22M weekly downloads |
| **Getting Started** | 9/10 | Excellent docs, 15-min setup with Next.js |
| **Ecosystem** | 10/10 | 10,000+ libraries, every tool has React support |
| **Hiring** | 10/10 | 50,000+ jobs, widest talent pool |
| **Momentum** | 8/10 | Growing slowly (68% → 70%), stable dominance |
| **TOTAL** | **47/50** | **Clear leader in S1 methodology** |

---

## Red Flags / Concerns

**Minor**:
- Bundle size larger than competitors (mitigated by ecosystem value)
- Lower developer satisfaction than Svelte/Solid (still 80%, acceptable)

**None critical**: No major red flags from S1 rapid perspective.

---

## S1 Recommendation

**Status**: **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION**

**Rationale**: React + Next.js dominates all S1 criteria (adoption, hiring, ecosystem, getting started). 47/50 score is highest among all frameworks evaluated.

**Confidence**: **HIGH** (overwhelming signals)

**When to choose**: Default choice for 80% of projects. Only consider alternatives if performance is critical (Svelte) or team has strong Vue/Angular expertise.
