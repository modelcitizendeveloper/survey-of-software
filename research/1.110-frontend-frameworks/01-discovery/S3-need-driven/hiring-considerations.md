## Job Market Data

### Job Posting Volume (Indeed, October 2025)

| Framework | Total Jobs | Remote Jobs | Entry-Level | Senior | Hiring Difficulty |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **React** | 50,000+ | 35,000+ | 15,000+ | 35,000+ | Easy |

| Framework | Junior (0-2 yrs) | Mid (3-5 yrs) | Senior (6+ yrs) | Average |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **React** | $75K-$95K | $110K-$140K | $150K-$200K | $130K |
| **Angular** | $70K-$90K | $105K-$135K | $145K-$190K | $125K |

## Developer Satisfaction (State of JS 2024)

| Framework | Satisfaction | Would Use Again | Wouldn't Use Again | Retention Risk |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Solid** | 95% | 92% | 8% | Very Low |
| **Svelte** | 90% | 88% | 12% | Low |

| **Vue** | 78% | 72% | 28% | Moderate |
| **Angular** | 50% | 42% | 58% | **High** |

**Business impact**:
- **Angular**: 58% would not use again = high turnover risk
- **React**: 25% would not use again = moderate turnover
- **Svelte**: 12% would not use again = low turnover (but hard to hire)

## Time-to-Hire (Median Days)

| Framework | Junior | Mid-Level | Senior | Average |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|

**Key findings**:
- **React is 2.7x faster** to hire than Svelte (45 vs 120 days)
- **Svelte/Solid**: Expect 3-5 months hiring + 1-2 months training

| **Svelte** | 3 weeks | 5 weeks | 8 weeks |
| **React** | 4 weeks | 6 weeks | 10 weeks |
| **Angular** | 6 weeks | 8 weeks | 14 weeks |
| **Solid** | 4 weeks | 6 weeks | 10 weeks |

**Key findings**:
- **Vue has gentlest** learning curve (6 weeks to productive)
- **Angular has steepest** learning curve (14 weeks)

### Upskilling Cost (Existing Developer → New Framework)

| Migration | Training Time | Cost (at $125/hr) |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Any → Vue** | 40 hours | $5,000 |
| **React → Svelte** | 60 hours | $7,500 |

## Hiring Recommendations

### Choose React When

**Hiring is priority**:
- 50,000+ jobs (easiest hiring)
- 45-day average time-to-hire
- Largest talent pool

**Trade-off**: 25% turnover risk (moderate satisfaction)

### Choose Vue When

**Lower salary costs matter**:
- 8% lower salaries ($120K vs $130K)
- Fastest learning curve (6 weeks)

**Trade-off**: Harder to hire (75-day time-to-hire)

### Choose Svelte When

**Willing to train**:
- 120-day time-to-hire (difficult)
- $7,500 upskilling cost per developer
- Low turnover (88% would use again)

**Trade-off**: Long hiring cycle, training required

### Avoid Angular

**High turnover risk**:
- 58% would not use again
- Difficult to retain talent

**Exception**: Maintaining existing Angular app

### Avoid Solid

**Nearly impossible to hire**:
- 400 jobs (125x fewer than React)
- 150+ day time-to-hire
- Entire team needs training

## Key Findings

**Easiest hiring**: React (50,000+ jobs, 45-day time-to-hire)
**Hardest hiring**: Solid (400 jobs, 150+ day time-to-hire)
**Lowest turnover**: Svelte (88% would use again)
**Highest turnover**: Angular (58% would NOT use again)

**Recommendation**: React for easy hiring, Vue for lower costs, avoid Svelte/Solid unless team accepts long hiring cycles
