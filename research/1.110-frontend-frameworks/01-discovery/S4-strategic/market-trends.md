- **Angular job market is shrinking** (-8%/year, -6,000 jobs)
- **Svelte job market is growing fastest** (+25%/year), but small base

**Strategic implications**:
- React hiring will remain easy (growing job market)
- Angular hiring will become easier (fewer jobs, same talent pool) but signal of decline
- Svelte hiring will remain difficult (low absolute job count)

## Corporate Backing Trends

### Financial Stability

| Framework | Backing | Funding | Trajectory | Long-term Risk |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **React** | Meta (Facebook) | Internal | Stable | Low |

- **Angular is declining internally at Google** (fewer new projects)
- **Svelte/Solid are community-driven** (uncertain long-term funding)

**Strategic implications**:
- React is safest long-term (Meta + Vercel commitment)
- Angular risk is increasing (Google reducing investment)
- Svelte/Solid risk depends on community health (uncertain)
