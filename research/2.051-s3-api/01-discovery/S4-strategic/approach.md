# S4: Strategic Standard Viability - Approach

**Methodology**: S4 - Strategic Selection (Future-focused)
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Time Spent**: ~60 minutes

## Core Question
**"Will S3 API last? Is the standard strategically sound for 5+ year commitment?"**

## S4 Methodology for Open Standards (Tier 2)

S4 examines **long-term standard viability** - governance health, adoption trends, fragmentation risks, and future-proofing.

### S4 Focus Areas for Standards:

1. **Governance Health**:
   - Who controls the standard?
   - Is governance stable and sustainable?
   - What's the risk of abandonment or breaking changes?

2. **Adoption Trajectory**:
   - Is adoption growing or declining?
   - Industry momentum and trends
   - New providers entering or exiting market?

3. **Fragmentation Risk**:
   - Competing standards emerging?
   - Providers diverging from standard?
   - Proprietary extensions breaking compatibility?

4. **Long-Term Portability Guarantees**:
   - Backward compatibility track record
   - API stability commitments
   - Migration cost evolution over time

## Discovery Approach

**Future-oriented research** (S4 characteristic):
- Analyze API evolution since 2006
- Track new S3-compatible provider launches
- Identify competing object storage standards
- Assess Amazon's incentives for API stability
- Evaluate industry adoption trends

**What S4 Does NOT Do** (reserved for current-state analysis):
- Current feature compatibility (covered in S2)
- Immediate use case fit (covered in S3)

## Evaluation Criteria

**Standard Viability**:
- ✅ **Strong**: Growing adoption, stable governance, low fragmentation risk
- ⚠️ **Moderate**: Stable but concerning trends
- ❌ **Weak**: Declining adoption or high fragmentation

**5-Year Outlook**:
- Safe bet: Standard will be widely supported
- Risky: Uncertainty about future compatibility
- Avoid: Standard likely to fragment or decline
