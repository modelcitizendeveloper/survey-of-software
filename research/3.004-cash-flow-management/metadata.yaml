notes: "Originally completed Oct 22, 2025 using MPSE v2.0 monolithic format. Migrated to detailed_toc format Nov 13, 2025 with addition of Pigment and Datarails (enterprise platforms). Migration triggered by client request for decision analysis including these platforms. Research expanded from 8 to 10 platforms, from 3 to 4 market tiers."

summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of 10 cash flow and FP&A SaaS platforms across 4 market tiers (Small Business: Pulse/Fathom $29-150/mo, Startup/SMB: Finmark/Jirav/Causal $100-800/mo, Mid-Market: Mosaic/Dryrun/PlanGuru/Datarails $500-5,000/mo, Enterprise: Pigment $6,000-20,000/mo). Nov 13, 2025 update added Datarails (Excel-native, 200+ integrations, dedicated cash management 2024) and Pigment (AI-powered enterprise planning, $1B unicorn). Research validated top-down discovery approach, documented data source limitations, and mapped business scenarios to platforms. Strategic finding: Market now includes enterprise FP&A platforms (Pigment) competing with Anaplan/Planful, and Excel-native vs. replace-Excel positioning is critical decision point. Key variables: company size (1-10,000+ employees), existing tools (QuickBooks vs. NetSuite vs. Snowflake), primary need (cash visibility vs. full FP&A vs. enterprise planning), budget ($29/mo-$250K/year), Excel dependency (native vs. replace), vendor stability preference (60-95% 5-year confidence).

key_findings:
  market_structure:
    tier_1_small_business: "Pulse ($29-89/mo), Fathom ($53-265/mo) - 1-20 employees, cash flow focus, QuickBooks integration"
    pulse_multi_client_limitation: "CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Nov 18, 2025): Pulse does NOT support fractional controllers managing multiple client companies. Pulse's 'companies' feature tracks YOUR customers (revenue sources), NOT separate businesses you manage. Premium's 'unlimited accounts' = bank accounts within ONE company, not multiple companies. Source: Pulse help docs."
    fathom_multi_client_pricing: "CONFIRMED (Nov 18, 2025): Fathom Business Advisors plan - $53/company/month (1-9 companies), $28/company/month (10+ bulk discount). 5 clients = $265/mo, 10 clients = $280/mo. Professional report generation key value-add for fractional CFOs."
    tier_2_startup_smb: "Finmark ($100-300/mo), Jirav ($50-750/mo), Causal ($500-800/mo) - 20-100 employees, full FP&A, modern integrations"
