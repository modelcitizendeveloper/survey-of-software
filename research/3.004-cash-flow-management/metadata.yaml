notes: "First Tier 3 experiment using MPSE v2.0 monolithic format (single files per methodology vs. multiple files). Research conducted top-down (Tier 3 before Tier 1) per framework design. Data source limitations documented (G2/Capterra blocked, used technical documentation instead)."

summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of 8 cash flow and FP&A SaaS platforms across 3 market tiers (Small Business: Pulse/Fathom $29-150/mo, Startup/SMB: Finmark/Jirav/Causal $100-800/mo, Mid-Market: Mosaic/Dryrun $500-2,000/mo). Research validated top-down discovery approach (start at Tier 3 SaaS, work down to Tier 1 libraries), documented data source limitations (respect T&C restrictions on review sites), and mapped 15 business scenarios to specific platforms. Strategic finding: Context determines optimal platform - no universal winner. Key variables: company size (1-500 employees), existing tools (QuickBooks vs. NetSuite vs. Snowflake), primary need (cash visibility vs. full FP&A), budget ($29-2,000/mo), lock-in tolerance ($750-$9K escape cost), vendor stability preference (95% vs. 60% 5-year confidence).
