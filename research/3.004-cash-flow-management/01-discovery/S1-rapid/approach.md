- Target market (company size, industry, use cases)
- Pricing model and cost structure
- Key differentiators
- Notable customers
- Integration capabilities
- Platform strengths and limitations

## Data Sources

**Primary Sources**:
- Platform websites (public marketing, pricing pages where available)
- Technical documentation (API docs, integration guides)
- Platform blog posts, case studies, product announcements
- Integration marketplace data
- Recent funding announcements, acquisition news

**Secondary Sources**:
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
- User review aggregates (G2, Capterra - public summary data only)
- Procurement benchmarking (Vendr, TrustRadius)

**Limitations**:
- Pricing: 8 of 10 platforms do not publish transparent pricing (custom quotes)
- Customer counts: Not all platforms disclose
- Implementation costs: Estimates based on industry benchmarks
- Churn rates: Not publicly available

---

## Research Philosophy

**Hardware Store Principle**: Generic catalog content applicable to any buyer context. No client-specific recommendations or "Choose X if..." prescriptive guidance in S1.

**Factual Focus**: Document what platforms provide, not which to choose.

**Integration Emphasis**: Capture accounting, ERP, HRIS, CRM, data warehouse integration capabilities (critical for cash flow/FP&A value).

**Cost Transparency**: Document pricing where available, estimate TCO where not published.

**Cash Flow Focus**: While many platforms are full FP&A suites, emphasize cash flow forecasting, cash runway tracking, and working capital management capabilities.

## Format Migration Notes

**Original Format** (Oct 22, 2025): Monolithic S1-RAPID.md file (613 lines)
**New Format** (Nov 13, 2025): Detailed_toc with individual platform files

**Migration Approach**:
1. Extract platform profiles from S1-RAPID.md → individual files
2. Expand Datarails and Pigment to full depth (~500-1000 lines each)
3. Maintain original research for existing 8 platforms
4. Add new research for 2 enterprise platforms

## Next Steps

**S2 Comprehensive**: Feature matrices, pricing/TCO detailed analysis, integration architecture
**S3 Need-Driven**: Business scenario mapping (separate from generic catalog)
**S4 Strategic**: Vendor viability, build-vs-buy, AI evolution outlook
