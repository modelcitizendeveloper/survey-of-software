# S3: Need-Driven Discovery - Cash Flow Management Platforms
**Research ID:** 3.004 (Cash Flow & Financial Planning SaaS)
**Methodology:** S3 (Need-Driven)
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Philosophy:** "Requirements first, then find exact fits" - match specific needs to specific platforms

---

## Methodology: Need-Driven Analysis

**Focus:** Scenario-based recommendations for specific business contexts
**Best For:** Unique constraints, industry-specific needs, compliance requirements
**Approach:** Define 15+ scenarios, map optimal platform for each

---

## Data Sources & Limitations

**Accessible Sources (Used):**
- ✅ Platform technical documentation (API docs, integration guides)
- ✅ Platform feature specifications (published capabilities)
- ✅ Pricing pages (public pricing information)
- ✅ Platform websites (marketing content, case studies)
- ✅ Integration marketplace data (QuickBooks/Xero app stores)

**Blocked/Restricted Sources (Not Used):**
- ❌ G2.com (403 error - automated access prohibited by terms of service)
- ❌ Capterra (403 error - automated access prohibited by terms of service)

**Methodology Impact:**
- Cannot provide aggregated user review scores
- Cannot quantify "most popular by review count"
- Relying on platform-published materials and technical specifications
- S3 scenario matching based on documented capabilities, not user sentiment

**Why Technical Docs > Review Sites:**
Technical documentation provides superior signal:
- Factual capabilities vs. subjective opinions
- Actual limitations revealed (what it CAN'T do)
- API quality and extensibility visible
- Integration depth measurable
- Data models and architecture documented

---

## Scenario Framework

Each scenario includes:
- **Business context** (size, stage, industry)
- **Primary need** (what problem to solve)
- **Technical constraints** (existing tools, team skills)
- **Budget range**
- **Recommended platform(s)** with rationale
- **Runner-up alternatives**

---

## Scenario 1: Solo Founder, Pre-Revenue, Building Financial Model for Investors

**Context:**
- Founder raising pre-seed or seed round
- 0-2 employees

- Professional-looking output for investors
- Quick setup (pitch deadline in 2 weeks)

**Technical Constraints:**
- No accounting system yet

- Founder is non-finance background
- Needs simple, fast

**Recommended Platform: Finmark**

**Rationale:**

**Runner-Up: Jirav (Controller Essentials $50/mo)**
- AI-powered budget generation (faster setup)
- 2 plans included (base case + upside)
- Professional templates
- Slightly more complex than Finmark

**Why NOT Pulse:**
- Cash flow only (investors want full P&L + balance sheet + cash flow)

**Why NOT Direct-to-Business Platforms:**
- Finmark/Causal/Mosaic designed for single company, not multi-client
- No white-labeling
- No portfolio management
- Licensing per company (expensive for 20 clients)

---

- Professional CFO-grade forecasting
- Integration with Sage Intacct (no manual data entry)
- Foreign currency conversion (Subsidiary B is in Canada)

**Technical Constraints:**
- MUST integrate with Sage Intacct (deal-breaker)
- Finance team knows Excel well (want better, not different paradigm)
- Need manual override capability (don't trust black-box automation)
- Complex organizational structure

**Recommended Platform: Dryrun (~$800-1,200/mo estimated)**

**Rationale:**
- **Sage Intacct integration** (few platforms support it)
- Multi-entity consolidation built-in
- Scenario modeling is core feature (not add-on)
- Live currency conversion (Canadian subsidiary)
- **Manual control options** (finance team can override automation)
- **Excel integration** (works WITH Excel, not against it)

**Runner-Up: Mosaic (~$1,500/mo)**
- Sage Intacct integration
- Multi-entity consolidation with FX
- 150+ metrics (more than needed but available)
- Real-time data
- **Missing:** Excel integration (Mosaic wants you to leave Excel entirely)
- **Missing:** Manual control emphasis (more automated, less override)

**Why NOT Lower-Tier Platforms:**
- Finmark/Jirav don't support Sage Intacct
- Pulse/Fathom not designed for multi-entity manufacturing
- Causal supports NetSuite but not Sage Intacct

---

**Context:**
- Restaurant with 3 locations
- $3M annual revenue
- 40 employees
- Daily cash operations (cash + credit card)
- Uses Square POS + QuickBooks
- Budget: $100-200/month

**Primary Need:**
- Daily cash flow visibility (not weekly - need daily)
- Multi-location consolidation (see each location + total)
- Cash on hand tracking (daily deposits, change needed)
- Scenario planning (what if Location C underperforms?)
- Simple enough for GM to use (not finance professional)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Uses Square POS (most transactions)
- QuickBooks for accounting
- GMs are not financially sophisticated
- Need mobile access (check from restaurant floor)

**Recommended Platform: Pulse (Premium $89/mo)**

**Rationale:**
- **Daily cash flow views** (critical for restaurants)
- Multi-account management (3 locations = 3 accounts)
- QuickBooks integration (if Square syncs to QB, Pulse sees it)
- Scenario modeling (toggle Location C on/off)

- Simple UX (GMs can learn quickly)

**Runner-Up: Fathom (~$100-150/mo)**
- Multi-entity consolidation (3 locations)
- KPI tracking (revenue per location)

- Project-level cash flow (when do payments come in?)
- Scenario modeling (what if we win Deal A but not Deal B?)
- Hiring plan (need to hire before projects start)
- Integration with Salesforce (pipeline data)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must integrate with Salesforce (pipeline is in CRM)
- Must integrate with QuickBooks (actuals)
- Finance team of 2 people
- Consultants are Excel-savvy

**Recommended Platform: Causal (Growth Plan ~$500-800/mo)**

**Rationale:**
- **Salesforce integration** (pipeline → revenue forecast)

- HubSpot integration (if willing to switch from Salesforce)

**Why NOT Lower-Tier Platforms:**
- Pulse: No CRM integration, no pipeline forecasting
- Finmark: No Salesforce integration
- Fathom: No CRM integration
- Jirav: No CRM integration mentioned

**Critical Requirement:** CRM integration for pipeline forecasting. Only Causal and Mosaic support Salesforce.

- KPI tracking (revenue per sq ft, labor %, etc.)
- Permission-based access (franchisees can't see each other)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Multiple accounting platforms (QB, Xero, others)
- Franchisees have varying sophistication

**Recommended Platform: Fathom (~$300-500/mo estimated multi-franchise)**

**Rationale:**
- **Group benchmarking built-in** (designed for franchises)
- Multi-entity consolidation (50 locations)
- Permission-based access (franchisees see only their data)
- Broad accounting platform support (QB, Xero, MYOB, Sage)

**Runner-Up: Jirav (CFO Enterprise ~$500-750/mo)**
- Multi-client management (can model as 50 "clients")
- Unlimited read-only (franchisees view-only)
- Best-practice templates
- Less explicit franchise focus than Fathom

**Why NOT Other Platforms:**
- Pulse: No group benchmarking
- Finmark/Causal: Not designed for multi-entity franchises
- Mosaic: Too expensive for franchise HQ budget
- Dryrun: Not optimized for franchise use case

---

## Scenario 11: High-Growth Startup, Rapid Hiring, Need Headcount Planning

**Context:**
- Tech startup (Series B)
- 80 employees, planning to hit 200 in 12 months

- Uses Gusto (payroll), BambooHR (HRIS)
- VC board wants hiring plan visibility
- Budget: $500-1,000/month

**Primary Need:**
- Headcount planning (model hiring by department)
- Cost forecast (each hire = salary + benefits + taxes)
- Scenario modeling (hire fast vs. hire slow)
- Integration with payroll/HRIS (actual headcount sync)
- Runway calculation (when do we run out of cash at this burn rate?)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must integrate with Gusto or BambooHR (headcount data)
- Finance team of 3 people

- More expensive but more features (150+ metrics)

**Why NOT Lower-Tier Platforms:**
- Finmark: Has hiring planning, but no NetSuite integration
- Jirav: No NetSuite integration mentioned
- Pulse/Fathom: No headcount planning modules

**Critical Requirement:** NetSuite integration (Series B companies often use enterprise ERP). Only Causal and Mosaic support NetSuite.

---

## Scenario 12: Bootstrap SaaS, Profitable, Want to Stay Independent

**Context:**
- Bootstrapped SaaS company
- $3M ARR, profitable
- 15 employees
- No outside investors
- Founder wants to avoid unnecessary costs
- Budget: $100-200/month max

**Primary Need:**
- SaaS metrics tracking (ARR, MRR, churn)
- Profitability forecasting
- Simple scenario modeling (what if we hire 2 more engineers?)
- Integration with Stripe (revenue), QuickBooks (expenses)
- No investor reporting needed (bootstrap = no board)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Uses Stripe (billing)
- Uses QuickBooks Online
- Finance is founder + bookkeeper (2 people)
- Wants simple, not over-engineered

**Recommended Platform: Finmark (~$100-200/mo at $3M ARR)**

- Stripe integration (revenue/MRR tracking)
- QuickBooks integration (expenses)
- Unlimited users (founder + bookkeeper)

- QuickBooks integration
- Cash flow focus (important for bootstrap profitability)
- **Missing:** SaaS metrics (would need to calculate separately)

**Why NOT Higher-Tier Platforms:**
- Causal (~$500+/mo): Too expensive for bootstrap mentality
- Mosaic (~$1,500/mo): Way too expensive
- Jirav: Designed for accountant channel, not bootstrap SaaS

**Bootstrap Mentality:** Spend minimum on tools, maximize profitability. Finmark at ~$150/mo is tolerable. Causal at $500+/mo feels wasteful.

---

## Scenario 13: Agency (Creative/Marketing), Retainer + Project Mix, Need Client Profitability

**Context:**
- Creative agency
- $4M annual revenue
- 30 employees
- Mix of retainers (predictable) + projects (lumpy)
- 20-30 active clients at any time
- Uses QuickBooks + Google Sheets for client tracking
- Budget: $200-400/month

**Primary Need:**
- Client-level profitability (which clients are profitable?)
- Project-level cash flow (when do project payments come in?)
- Scenario modeling (what if we lose Client A?)
- Staff utilization tracking (who's billable vs. bench?)
- Mix of recurring + one-time revenue

**Technical Constraints:**
- Uses QuickBooks Online
- Client data currently in Google Sheets
- Finance person is ops manager (not finance background)
- Small finance budget (spend on creative talent, not tools)

**Recommended Platform: Pulse (Premium $89/mo)**

**Rationale:**

- Simple enough for ops manager

**Runner-Up: Fathom (~$100-150/mo)**
- Client-level reporting
- KPI tracking (revenue per client)
- QuickBooks integration
- More comprehensive than Pulse, but more expensive

**Why NOT Higher-Tier Platforms:**
- Finmark: No emphasis on client-level profitability
- Jirav: Over-engineered for agency use case
- Causal/Mosaic: Way too expensive for agency margins

**Agency Specific:** Pulse explicitly mentions "agencies" as target customer. Client/project-level reporting is core feature.

---

## Scenario 14: Real Estate Developer, Multiple Projects, Construction Draws

**Context:**
- Real estate development firm
- 3-5 active projects (mixed-use, multifamily)
- Construction financing (draw-based)
- Each project = separate legal entity
- Uses QuickBooks for each entity
- Budget: $300-600/month

**Primary Need:**
- Project-level cash flow (when do we need next draw?)
- Multi-project consolidation (portfolio view)
- Construction timeline → cash needs mapping
- Scenario modeling (what if project delays 3 months?)
- Lender reporting (banks want quarterly cash flow statements)

**Technical Constraints:**
- Each project = separate QuickBooks file
- Complex: construction draws, equity capital calls, eventual sale
- Developer is financially sophisticated (ex-finance)
- Need professional output (lender reporting)

**Recommended Platform: Dryrun (~$500-800/mo estimated)**

**Rationale:**
- **Multi-entity consolidation** (each project = entity)
- Scenario modeling for delays (construction timelines shift)
- Professional-grade forecasting (lender reporting)
- QuickBooks multi-entity support
- Manual control options (developer can model complex structures)
- Excel integration (developer may supplement with custom models)

**Runner-Up: Fathom (~$200-300/mo)**
- Multi-entity consolidation
- QuickBooks integration (multiple files)
- Professional reporting
- Less expensive than Dryrun
- **Missing:** Deep scenario modeling (real estate needs complex what-ifs)

**Why NOT Other Platforms:**
- Pulse: No multi-entity consolidation
- Finmark/Causal: Not designed for real estate project finance
- Mosaic: Too expensive for real estate margins

**Real Estate Specific:** Complex project finance (draws, capital calls, sales) requires professional-grade tool. Dryrun's scenario modeling fits real estate sensitivity analysis.

---

## Scenario 15: Data-Driven CFO, Using Snowflake, Want Best-in-Class

**Context:**
- Mid-market SaaS company
- $30M ARR
- 150 employees
- Data warehouse (Snowflake) with all company data
- Technical finance team (3 people, all ex-investment banking)
- Budget: $1,000-2,000/month

**Primary Need:**
- Connect directly to data warehouse (Snowflake)
- Custom metrics (beyond pre-built)
- Multi-dimensional modeling (by product, by segment, by channel)
- Eliminate Excel entirely (CFO hates spreadsheets)
- Best-in-class modern tool (CFO came from tech company)

**Technical Constraints:**
- MUST integrate with Snowflake (deal-breaker)
- Uses NetSuite (enterprise ERP)
- Uses Salesforce (CRM)
- Technical finance team (comfortable with APIs, SQL)
- Want cutting-edge, not traditional

**Recommended Platform: Causal (Growth Plan ~$800-1,200/mo)**

**Rationale:**
- **Snowflake integration** (only Causal and Mosaic support)
- NetSuite integration (enterprise ERP)
- Salesforce integration (CRM)
- Multi-dimensional modeling (by product/segment/channel)
- Natural language formulas ("100x fewer formulas")
- Version control (Git-like model management)
- Transaction drill-down (click any number, see source)
- Modern, technical team appeal
- **More affordable than Mosaic** (~$800 vs. ~$1,500)

**Runner-Up: Mosaic (~$1,500-2,000/mo)**
- Snowflake integration
- NetSuite, Salesforce integration
- 150+ pre-built metrics
- AI insights (Arc AI)
- Real-time data
- More expensive but more automation

**Why NOT Other Platforms:**
- None support Snowflake except Causal and Mosaic
- Lower-tier platforms can't handle data warehouse complexity
- Traditional platforms (PlanGuru, Fathom) don't match "best-in-class" requirement

**Data Warehouse as Signal:** If company uses Snowflake, they need enterprise-grade tool. Only 2 options: Causal or Mosaic.

---

## Cross-Scenario Pattern Recognition

### Pattern 1: Integration Requirements Drive Choice

**If you use Sage Intacct:** Dryrun or Mosaic only
**If you use NetSuite:** Causal or Mosaic only
**If you use Snowflake:** Causal or Mosaic only
**If you use QuickBooks only:** Many options (Pulse, Fathom, Finmark, Jirav, etc.)
**If you use Salesforce:** Causal or Mosaic only

**Implication:** Enterprise ERP/CRM/data warehouse = narrow platform choices (Causal or Mosaic). SMB tools (QB, Xero) = many choices.

---

### Pattern 2: Company Stage → Price Tier

**Pre-revenue to $1M:** Pulse ($29-89/mo), Finmark ($100/mo), Jirav ($50/mo)
**$1M to $10M:** Finmark ($100-300/mo), Jirav ($150-300/mo), Causal ($500/mo)
**$10M to $50M:** Causal ($500-800/mo), Dryrun ($500-800/mo), Mosaic ($1,000/mo)
**$50M+:** Mosaic ($1,500-2,000/mo)

**Implication:** Revenue stage roughly correlates with tool budget and sophistication needs.

---

### Pattern 3: Industry-Specific Use Cases

**Restaurants/Hospitality:** Pulse (daily granularity, multi-location)
**Nonprofits:** PlanGuru (budget vs. actuals, annual licensing, affordable)
**Franchises:** Fathom (group benchmarking, multi-entity)
**Real Estate:** Dryrun (project-level, scenario-heavy, multi-entity)
**Agencies:** Pulse (client/project-level reporting, retainer + project mix)
**SaaS Startups:** Finmark or Causal (SaaS metrics, hiring plans, modern)
**Consulting:** Causal (Salesforce integration, pipeline forecasting)
**Manufacturing:** Dryrun (multi-entity, Sage Intacct, Excel-friendly)

**Implication:** Industry drives specific feature needs (daily cash for restaurants, SaaS metrics for SaaS, project-level for agencies).

---

### Pattern 4: User Sophistication Matters

**Non-finance users (owners, GMs):** Pulse (simplest UX)
**Finance-literate but not finance pros:** Finmark, Fathom, Jirav
**Finance professionals:** Dryrun, Causal, Mosaic
**Technical finance teams:** Causal (data warehouse, APIs)
**Accounting firms:** Jirav, Fathom (multi-client, white-label)

**Implication:** Don't give Excel-dependent CFO a "no spreadsheets" tool (use Dryrun). Don't give non-finance owner an enterprise tool (use Pulse).

### Pattern 5: Budget as Constraint vs. Investment

**Budget-constrained (bootstrap, nonprofit):** Pulse ($89/mo), PlanGuru ($300/yr)
**Budget-conscious (SMB, profitability focus):** Finmark ($100-200/mo), Jirav ($50-150/mo)
**Budget-flexible (growth stage, funded):** Causal ($500-800/mo)
**Budget-irrelevant (mid-market, ROI-focused):** Mosaic ($1,500+/mo - "replaces 1.5 FTE")

**Implication:** Bootstrap/nonprofit will never choose Mosaic. Mid-market with 10-person finance team won't choose Pulse.

## S3 Summary: Scenario-Based Decision Tree

### Step 1: Identify Your Constraint

**Do you use enterprise ERP/CRM/data warehouse?**
- Sage Intacct → Dryrun or Mosaic
- NetSuite → Causal or Mosaic
- Snowflake → Causal or Mosaic
- Salesforce (need CRM integration) → Causal or Mosaic
- None of above → Continue to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Identify Your Primary Need

**Cash flow visibility only (not full FP&A):**
- Daily granularity needed (restaurant, retail) → Pulse
- Weekly/monthly ok → Pulse or Fathom

**Full FP&A (3-statement forecasting, budgeting, scenarios):**
- Continue to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Identify Your Scale

**Solo founder / pre-revenue:**
- Finmark ($100/mo) or Jirav Controller ($50/mo)

**Small business (1-20 employees, <$2M revenue):**
- Simple needs → Pulse ($29-89/mo)
- Full reporting → Fathom ($100/mo)

**Startup/SMB (20-100 employees, $2M-20M revenue):**
- SaaS company → Finmark ($100-300/mo) or Causal ($500/mo)
- Services/agency → Pulse ($89/mo) or Finmark ($100-200/mo)
- Accounting firm channel → Jirav ($50-750/mo)

**Mid-market (100-500 employees, $20M-100M revenue):**
- CFO-grade forecasting → Dryrun ($500-1,000/mo)
- Strategic finance platform → Mosaic ($1,500-2,000/mo)
- Technical finance team with data warehouse → Causal ($800-1,200/mo)

---

### Step 4: Special Cases

**Accounting firm serving clients?** → Jirav or Fathom
**Nonprofit?** → PlanGuru
**Franchise (multi-location)?** → Fathom
**Real estate (project finance)?** → Dryrun
**High-growth hiring (Series B+)?** → Causal or Mosaic
**Bootstrap SaaS (profitable, independent)?** → Finmark

## S3 Conclusion

**Key Insight:** Platform choice is CONTEXT-DEPENDENT. There is no universal "best" platform.

**Critical Variables:**
1. **Integrations** (QB vs. NetSuite vs. Snowflake)
2. **Scale** (1 person vs. 500 employees)
3. **Primary need** (cash visibility vs. scenario modeling vs. strategic finance)
4. **User sophistication** (owner vs. CFO vs. technical finance team)
5. **Budget** (bootstrap vs. VC-funded vs. mid-market)
6. **Industry** (SaaS vs. restaurant vs. real estate)

**Methodology Success:** S3 mapped 15 scenarios to specific platforms. Every scenario has a clear winner based on requirements.

**Next:** S4 Strategic Discovery will analyze vendor stability, build-vs-buy economics, lock-in mitigation, and long-term trends.
