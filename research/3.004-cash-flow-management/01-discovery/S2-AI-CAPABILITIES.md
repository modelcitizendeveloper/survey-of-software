## Strategic Decision Tree: In-House AI Capabilities

This section helps you decide your strategy based on whether your organization has (or plans to build) in-house AI/ML capabilities.

---

### Path A: No In-House AI Capabilities (Most Organizations)

**Strategy: Maximize Platform AI, Accept Gaps**

#### Platform Selection Priority:
1. **Best AI coverage:** Mosaic (60-70% coverage, Arc AI)
2. **Good AI + affordability:** Jirav (35-45% coverage, $50-300/mo)
3. **Acceptable:** Causal, Fathom, Finmark (25-40% coverage)

#### What to Build vs Buy:
| Capability | Strategy | Solution |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Cash flow forecasting** | Buy platform | Mosaic Arc AI, Jirav AI forecasts, or basic platform features |
| **Anomaly detection** | Buy platform (Mosaic only) | If not using Mosaic: manual review or third-party tools |
| **Variance analysis** | Buy platform | Mosaic Arc AI or manual analysis |
| **Scenario modeling** | Buy platform | All platforms support this |
| **Narrative reporting** | Accept gap or buy third-party | No platforms do this well - create templates |
| **Monte Carlo risk analysis** | Accept gap | Build in Excel/Python or hire analyst |
| **Benchmarking** | Buy platform (Fathom) or third-party | Look for industry-specific benchmark services |
| **Multi-system intelligence** | Buy integrations | Use platform integrations, manual analysis |

#### Decision Framework:
```
Q1: What's your budget for cash flow/FP&A software?
  <$100/mo → Pulse or Fathom (basic AI = 10-35%)
  $100-$500/mo → Jirav or Finmark (moderate AI = 35-45%)
  $500-$2,000/mo → Mosaic or Causal (best AI = 60-70%)

Q2: Which AI capabilities matter most?
  Anomaly detection → Mosaic (only option)
  AI budgeting → Jirav
  Forecasting → Mosaic or Jirav
  Multi-system integration → Causal

Q3: For gaps, can you accept manual workarounds?
  Yes → Choose platform, do narratives/Monte Carlo manually
  No → Reconsider Path B or hire analysts
```

#### Action Plan:
1. Select AI-rich platform based on budget (Mosaic > Jirav > others)
2. Identify critical gaps (e.g., narrative reporting, Monte Carlo)
3. Build manual workarounds (Excel models, analyst reports)
4. Accept remaining gaps as unavailable until market matures

---

### Path B: Have In-House AI/ML Capabilities (Data Science Team, ML Engineers)

**Strategy: Use Platform for Basics, Build Custom AI for High-Value Gaps**

#### Platform Selection Priority:
1. **API access is critical** - prioritize platforms with robust APIs:
   - **Best APIs:** Causal (data warehouse connections), Mosaic, Jirav
   - **Good APIs:** Finmark, Fathom
   - **Limited APIs:** Pulse, Dryrun

2. **Don't overpay for platform AI** - if you're building custom, choose based on:
   - Data export capabilities
   - Integration breadth
   - Total cost (don't pay premium for Mosaic Arc AI if you're building your own)

#### What to Build vs Buy:
| Capability | Strategy | Why Build Custom |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Cash flow forecasting** | **Build custom** | Platform forecasting is basic, custom ML (Prophet, LSTM) far superior |
| **Monte Carlo risk analysis** | **Build custom** | 0% platform coverage, massive value, Python implementation straightforward |
| **Narrative reporting** | **Build custom** | 0% platform coverage, high ROI for board/investor relations |
| **Dynamic reforecasting** | **Build custom** | Platforms don't do this, critical for fast-moving companies |
| **Cross-system intelligence** | **Build custom** | Platforms integrate but don't analyze, LLM layer adds huge value |
| **Anomaly detection** | Build if not using Mosaic | Mosaic covers 70%, custom ML (Isolation Forest) superior |
| **Variance analysis** | Buy if using Mosaic, build otherwise | Mosaic Arc AI is good, custom can be better |
| **Scenario modeling** | Buy platform | Platforms do this well, not worth custom build |

Q2: Which platform are you using?
  Mosaic → Build: Monte Carlo, narratives, dynamic reforecasting (30-40% gap)
  Jirav/Causal/Fathom → Build: Most opportunities (55-75% gap)
  Pulse/Finmark/Dryrun → Build: Nearly everything (70-90% gap)

Q3: What's your FP&A platform strategy?
  Staying on current platform → Build custom AI layer on top
  Migrating to better platform → Wait until after migration
  Uncertain → Build platform-agnostic (data warehouse + ML layer)
```

#### Action Plan:
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Build data warehouse + ETL from accounting/payroll/revenue systems
2. **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Implement #1 opportunity (Monte Carlo risk modeling)
3. **Phase 3 (Months 7-9):** Add advanced time series forecasting
4. **Phase 4 (Months 10-12):** Expand to narrative reporting and dynamic reforecasting

- 1 Data Engineer ($120K-150K/year)
- Total: $270K-350K/year in salary + $50K-100K infrastructure = **$320K-450K/year**

**Alternative: Part-Time/Consultant:**
- ML Consultant ($150-300/hour, 10-20 hours/week)
- Estimated: $78K-312K/year depending on hours and scope

#### Expected ROI by Capability:
| Capability | Investment | Annual Benefit | ROI | Payback Period |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----|----------------|
| **Monte Carlo forecasting** | $40K-80K | $100K-500K (avoid cash crises, optimize fundraising) | 125%-1250% | 2-10 months |
| **Advanced time series forecasting** | $50K-100K | $50K-200K (better decisions, reduced waste) | 50%-400% | 3-24 months |
| **Narrative reporting** | $30K-60K | $40K-80K (CFO/controller time) | 67%-267% | 9-18 months |
| **Dynamic reforecasting** | $40K-80K | $60K-120K (faster decisions) | 75%-300% | 8-16 months |
| **Cross-system intelligence** | $75K-150K | $60K-120K (analyst time savings) | 40%-160% | 12-30 months |

#### Decision Framework:
```
Q1: Can you justify $320K-450K/year in AI team costs?
  Revenue <$5M → Probably not (use Path A)
  Revenue $5M-$20M → Maybe (focus on Monte Carlo only, consultant)
  Revenue $20M-$100M → Likely yes (multiple high-ROI opportunities)
  Revenue >$100M → Definitely (ROI is clear, need custom sophistication)

Q2: What's your risk tolerance?
  Low → Path A (buy platform AI), revisit in 2-3 years
  Medium → Hire 1 ML consultant, pilot Monte Carlo forecasting
  High → Hire full team, build comprehensive AI layer

Q3: Do you have critical gaps platforms don't address?
  No → Path A (buy platform AI)
  Yes, 1-2 critical gaps → Hire consultant for targeted build
  Yes, 3+ critical gaps → Path B (build in-house capabilities)
```

#### Pilot Project Recommendation:
**Start with Monte Carlo Risk Modeling (Highest ROI, Lowest Risk)**

1. **Phase 1 (Month 1):** Hire ML consultant (20 hours/week)
2. **Phase 2 (Month 2-3):** Build Monte Carlo simulation for cash runway
3. **Phase 3 (Month 4):** Test with historical data, validate accuracy
4. **Phase 4 (Month 5-6):** Deploy for forecasting, measure decision impact
5. **Decision Point (Month 6):**
   - If ROI >200% → Expand to additional capabilities, consider full hire
   - If ROI 50%-200% → Continue with consultant on Monte Carlo only
   - If ROI <50% → Terminate project, stick with Path A

**Investment:** $50K-75K (consultant + infrastructure)
**Expected Benefit:** $100K-500K/year (avoid cash crises, optimize fundraising timing)
**Risk:** Low (Monte Carlo is universally valuable, portable across platforms)

## Summary: Which Path is Right for You?

| Organization Profile | Recommended Path | Platform Choice | Build Strategy |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Small business (<$5M revenue)** | Path A | Jirav or Fathom | Buy platform AI, accept gaps |
| **Mid-market ($5M-$50M), no data science team** | Path A | Mosaic (best AI) | Buy best platform AI available |
| **Mid-market ($5M-$50M), have data science team** | Path C → B | Causal or Jirav | Pilot Monte Carlo, then expand |
| **Large ($50M-$100M), no data science team** | Path A or C | Mosaic | Evaluate ROI of building team |
| **Large ($50M-$100M), have data science team** | Path B | Causal or Finmark | Build comprehensive custom AI layer |
| **Enterprise ($100M+)** | Path B | Any platform with good APIs | Definitely build, ROI is clear |

---

**Conclusion:** Even the most advanced platform (Mosaic Arc AI) leaves 30-40% opportunity space for custom LLM/AI development. For most platforms, 55-90% of advanced AI capabilities remain available to build. Organizations with in-house AI capabilities and >$20M revenue should seriously evaluate building custom solutions for Monte Carlo risk modeling, advanced forecasting, and narrative generation - these offer 125-1250% ROI.
