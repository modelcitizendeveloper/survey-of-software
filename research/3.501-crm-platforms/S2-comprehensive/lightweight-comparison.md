## When to Choose Each Platform

### Choose Zoho Bigin If:
✅ Budget is primary constraint (<$50/month)
✅ You need 70-80% of CRM features, not 100%
✅ Simple pipeline management (6 pipelines sufficient)
✅ Built-in calling is valuable (saves integration costs)
✅ Room to upgrade to Zoho CRM later

**Wine bar with B2B wholesale**: ✅ Perfect fit - 10-50 B2B accounts, budget-conscious

**Avoid if**: Need unlimited pipelines, want best-in-class UX

---

### Choose Pipedrive If:
✅ Visual pipeline is core to sales process
✅ Team coordination important (5-10 people)
✅ Budget allows $29/user/month (Advanced plan)
✅ Sales analytics matter (conversion rates, forecasting)
✅ Integration ecosystem important (400+ apps)

**Avoid if**: Budget <$30/user, calling-heavy workflow, marketing-led

---

### Choose Close If:
✅ Calling is >70% of sales activity
✅ Team makes >30 calls/day per rep
✅ Email sequences critical (multi-touch outreach)
✅ Can afford $25-59/user AND have 3+ users
✅ Want all-in-one sales engagement platform

---

### Choose Copper If:
✅ Team lives in Gmail (Google Workspace required)
✅ Gmail-native workflow non-negotiable
✅ Budget allows $69/user/month for automation
✅ Google Calendar, Contacts, Drive integration critical

**Avoid if**: Not on Google Workspace, budget-conscious, need calling features

---

## Feature Gap Analysis

### What Bigin Lacks (vs Pipedrive):
❌ Visual drag-and-drop pipeline (Bigin is list-based)
❌ Unlimited pipelines (Bigin caps at 6)
❌ 400+ app marketplace (Bigin relies on Zapier)
❌ Advanced sales analytics (limited reporting)

**Worth the $29 vs $7 premium?** Only if visual pipeline and unlimited stages are critical to your sales process.

---

### What Pipedrive Lacks (vs Close):
❌ Built-in power dialer (requires integration like Aircall: $30+/user extra)
❌ Built-in SMS (requires integration)
❌ Sophisticated email sequences (basic automation, not sales engagement)
❌ Call coaching features

**Close worth 2-3x cost?** Only if calling is primary sales motion (>30 calls/day per rep).

---

### What Copper Lacks (vs Competitors):
❌ Built-in calling (Gmail-focused, not call-focused)
❌ Competitive pricing (most expensive in segment)
❌ Email sequences (basic automation only)

**Copper worth premium?** Only if Gmail-native workflow saves >1 hour/day per rep.
