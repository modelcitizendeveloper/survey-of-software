# Scenario: SaaS Startup (0-500 Customers)

**Business Pattern**: Early-stage SaaS with product-led OR sales-led growth

---

## Context

**Customer Base**: 0-500 paying customers (growing)

**Team**: Solo founder → 10-person team over 2 years

**Budget**: $0-500/month for CRM (grows with team)

**Sales Motion**:
- **Product-led**: Free trial → conversion (inbound)
- **Sales-led**: Outbound prospecting, demos, proposals

**Tech Stack**: Web app, email marketing, payment processor

---

## Recommended Platform

### Phase 1 (0-100 customers, solo founder): HubSpot Free

**Why**:
- ✅ **$0 cost** while bootstrapping
- ✅ **Unlimited users** (add team as you grow)
- ✅ **Marketing tools** included (landing pages, forms, email)
- ✅ **Learn inbound methodology** (valuable even if you switch later)

**Exit plan**: Migrate to Pipedrive or Zoho CRM before hitting free tier limits

---

### Phase 2 (100-500 customers, 5-10 person team): Pipedrive Advanced

**Why**:
- ✅ **Visual pipeline** for team coordination
- ✅ **Workflow automation** at $29/user (affordable for funded startup)
- ✅ **Sales analytics** (conversion rates, forecast)
- ✅ **Team management** features

**Cost**: $290/month for 10 users (reasonable at this scale)

---

## Alternative Paths

### Alternative 1: Stay with HubSpot (if marketing-led)

**When to choose**:
- Inbound marketing is core strategy (content, SEO)
- Want all-in-one platform
- Can afford $1,600+/month (HubSpot Professional)

**Trade-off**: Higher cost, lock-in risk

---

### Alternative 2: Zoho Bigin → Zoho CRM (if budget-conscious)

**When to choose**:
- Bootstrapped, every dollar counts
- Simple sales process
- Don't need best-in-class UX

**Cost**: $7-14/user vs $29/user for Pipedrive

---

## Avoid

❌ **Salesforce** (too early, too expensive, too complex)
❌ **Close** (unless sales motion is 70%+ calling)

---

## Migration Path

**Months 1-12** (0-100 customers):
- HubSpot Free (learn, build process)
- OR Zoho Bigin if avoiding lock-in from day 1

**Months 12-24** (100-500 customers):
- Migrate to Pipedrive Advanced ($29/user)
- OR upgrade to HubSpot Starter/Professional
- OR Zoho CRM if staying budget-conscious

**Years 2-5** (500-5,000 customers):
- Stay with Pipedrive/Hub Spot/Zoho
- OR upgrade to Salesforce only if complexity demands it

---

## Decision Framework

**Ask**: What's our primary customer acquisition motion?

**If inbound-led** (content, SEO, product-led):
→ HubSpot Free → HubSpot Professional

**If outbound-led** (cold email, demos, sales-driven):
→ HubSpot Free OR Zoho Bigin → Pipedrive Advanced

**If calling-heavy** (cold calling, inside sales):
→ Close Startup ($25/user, 3-min)

**If bootstrapped** (every dollar counts):
→ Zoho Bigin → Zoho CRM

---

## Applies To

- SaaS startups (any vertical)
- Software product companies
- API/platform businesses
- Developer tools
- B2B software vendors

**Pattern**: Any early-stage software company with growing customer base and evolving sales process
