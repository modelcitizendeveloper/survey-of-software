# S4: Strategic Viability Approach
**Time Budget**: 15-20 minutes
**Goal**: Lock-in analysis, pricing trajectory, long-term platform viability

---

## Methodology

Evaluate strategic risks and long-term considerations for each platform segment:

### 1. Vendor Lock-in Analysis (8 min)
- Data portability (export formats, API access)
- Migration complexity (automation rebuild, integration rewiring)
- Escape costs (time + money to switch)
- Lock-in by design (intentional vs accidental)

### 2. Pricing Trajectory (4 min)
- Historical pricing changes
- Revenue model incentives (how do they monetize growth?)
- Hidden cost creep (storage, API limits, feature gating)
- Predictable vs unpredictable cost scaling

### 3. Platform Viability (3 min)
- Company stability (funding, revenue, public vs private)
- Acquisition risk (could be acquired and shut down?)
- Product roadmap direction
- Market position sustainability
