## Standard Legitimacy Assessment

**Governance**: STRONG (CNCF backing, multi-vendor)
**Backend Support**: EXCELLENT (82 platforms, including all major cloud providers)
**Adoption**: HIGH (Fortune 500, industry standard status)
**Maturity**: MODERATE (Incubating, not Graduated, but 6+ years old)
**Activity**: HIGH (active development, growing interest)

## Quick Summary

OpenTelemetry is a legitimate, production-ready open standard with:
- Strong independent governance (CNCF)
- Massive backend support (82 vendors)
- Proven enterprise adoption (Fortune 500)
- Active development and growing ecosystem
- Minor concern: Not yet CNCF Graduated despite maturity
