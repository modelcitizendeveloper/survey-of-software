description: |
  Specialized research on graph database platforms, going deeper than 3.041 NoSQL
  coverage of Neo4j. Focus on avoiding vendor lock-in while evaluating graph
  databases for knowledge graph use case (representing research project relationships).

use_case: |
  Primary: Knowledge graph for research project relationships
  - Nodes: Research items (experiments, services, algorithms)
  - Edges: Relationships (complements, upstream_from, references, integrates_with)
  - Queries: Find dependencies, identify clusters, discover gaps

key_questions:
  - How to avoid Neo4j lock-in? (openCypher portability, Gremlin alternatives)
  - Managed vs self-hosted cost comparison
  - Graph query language comparison (Cypher vs Gremlin vs GraphQL)
  - Graph algorithms availability (PageRank, centrality, community detection)
  - Performance at scale (100-10,000 nodes, 1,000-100,000 edges)

providers_analyzed: 7
providers:
  - Neo4j Aura (market leader, Cypher, baseline for comparison)
  - Amazon Neptune (AWS, Gremlin + openCypher, managed)
  - ArangoDB (multi-model, AQL query language)
  - TigerGraph (enterprise analytics, GSQL)
  - Memgraph (in-memory, Cypher-compatible, low lock-in)
  - JanusGraph (open source, Gremlin, self-hosted)
  - Dgraph (GraphQL-native, open source)

    - code: "3.041"
      title: NoSQL Databases
      reason: Neo4j covered in 3.041, 3.045 expands with alternatives and lock-in mitigation

research_priorities:
  - openCypher portability (avoid Neo4j lock-in)
  - Gremlin vs Cypher comparison
  - Self-hosting options and costs
  - Graph algorithms (PageRank, centrality, community detection)
  - Knowledge graph use case (research project relationships)

notes: |
  Triggered by user interest in using graph database to represent research project
  as knowledge graph. Goal: Avoid expensive Neo4j lock-in while evaluating best
  graph database for relationship-heavy data model.
