## Key Findings

### Strategic Winners (5-Year Horizon)
1. **Bootstrap** (9/10): Community-owned, proven longevity, lowest risk
2. **Tailwind CSS** (8.5/10): Profitable business model, market leader, acceptable risk

### High-Risk Choices
- **Styled Components** (3/10): CSS-in-JS paradigm decline
- **Bulma** (5/10): Single-maintainer vulnerability
- **Pico CSS** (4/10): Small team, no funding
- **PandaCSS** (4/10): Too new (v0.x), unproven

### Strategic Recommendation
**For risk-averse organizations**: Bootstrap (stability, community ownership, zero lock-in)
**For velocity-focused teams**: Tailwind CSS (fast development, strong ecosystem, profitable)

**Avoid for strategic projects**: CSS-in-JS frameworks, single-maintainer frameworks, v0.x frameworks

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Maintenance sustainability**: Community ownership or profitable business model
2. **Web standards alignment**: CSS custom properties, zero runtime
3. **Low migration cost**: Semantic classes or standard CSS output
4. **Proven longevity**: 5+ years continuous maintenance
