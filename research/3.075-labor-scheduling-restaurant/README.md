## Research Overview

### Problem Statement

Labor = 30-35% of restaurant revenue (largest controllable cost). Seattle minimum wage ($20.76/hr, highest in US) makes optimization critical. Scheduling optimization reduces labor costs 2-5%, overtime prevention adds 1-3% savings. Compliance violations (Seattle Secure Scheduling Ordinance) = $500-5,000/incident.

### Platforms Evaluated (S1)

**6 Solutions** (5 SaaS + 1 DIY):
1. **7shifts** - $0-150/mo, free tier, mobile-first
2. **HotSchedules** - Custom pricing, AI forecasting, enterprise
3. **When I Work** - $5/user/mo, budget-friendly
4. **Deputy** - $0-4.50/user/mo, compliance-focused
5. **Sling by Toast** - $1.70-3.40/user/mo, Toast integration
6. **OR-Tools** - Free, Python constraint solver (DIY)

### Key Findings (S1)

**ROI**: 1,300-2,000% for 2-5% labor cost reduction
- $1.5M revenue × 30% labor = $450K
- 3% reduction = $13,500/year savings
- Platform cost: $420-$3,600/year
- **Net ROI**: $9,900-$13,080/year

**Seattle Compliance**: HotSchedules, Deputy enforce Secure Scheduling Ordinance (14-day notice, predictability pay, clopening restrictions)

**Free Tiers**: 7shifts Comp (20 employees), Deputy Starter (100 shifts/month)
