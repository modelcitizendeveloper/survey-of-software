## Strengths

✅ **Lowest per-user SaaS pricing**: $5/user beats 7shifts ($35/location), Deputy ($4.50/user), Sling ($1.70-3.40/user but limited free tier)
✅ **Simple interface**: Minimal learning curve, fast onboarding
✅ **Team communication focus**: Built-in messaging reduces external tools (Slack, WhatsApp)
✅ **Linear scaling**: Cost grows predictably with team size (vs location-based surprise costs)
✅ **14-day trial**: Test before committing

## Limitations

❌ **Limited PTO/shift features**: User complaints about time-off request workflows and shift updates
❌ **No AI forecasting**: Manual demand prediction only
❌ **No compliance automation**: Seattle Secure Scheduling Ordinance requires manual tracking
❌ **Basic reporting**: Lacks advanced labor analytics (labor %, forecasting trends)
❌ **No free tier**: Unlike 7shifts Comp (20 employees free) or Deputy Starter (100 shifts free)

## Best For

- **Budget-conscious single locations** (<$150/month budget)
- **Simple scheduling needs** (no AI, compliance, or advanced forecasting)
- **Team communication priority** (reduces need for separate messaging apps)
- **Predictable costs**: Per-user pricing easier to forecast than location-based

## Not Ideal For

- Very small restaurants wanting free tier (use 7shifts Comp or Deputy Starter)
- Compliance-heavy jurisdictions (Seattle, SF, NYC)
- AI forecasting needs (HotSchedules better)
- Toast POS users (Sling native integration better)

## Decision Factors

**Choose When I Work if**:
- Budget $50-200/month for scheduling
- Prioritize simplicity over advanced features
- Need team communication in scheduling platform
- Want predictable per-user pricing
- 10-30 employees (sweet spot for per-user vs location pricing)

**Skip When I Work if**:
- <10 employees and want free tier (7shifts, Deputy cheaper)
- Need compliance automation (HotSchedules, Deputy)
- Want AI forecasting (HotSchedules)
- Using Toast POS (Sling better integration)

## ROI Potential

**Time Savings** (primary value):
- Manual scheduling: 3-5 hours/week
- When I Work: 1 hour/week
- Savings: 2-4 hours/week = 104-208 hours/year
- At $25/hour = $2,600-$5,200/year
- Platform cost (20 employees): $1,200/year
- **Net ROI**: $1,400-$4,000/year or 117-333%

**Modest but positive ROI** for small restaurants. Higher-ROI platforms (7shifts free, Sling cheaper) available for budget-conscious operations.

## Competitive Position

**vs 7shifts**: Less expensive at 10+ employees ($5/user vs $35/location), but 7shifts has free tier <20
**vs Deputy**: Similar pricing ($5 vs $4.50/user), Deputy has compliance edge
**vs Sling**: When I Work $5/user vs Sling $1.70-3.40/user (Sling cheaper)
**vs HotSchedules**: Budget option vs enterprise (1/40th the cost, 1/10th the features)
