# Summary
summary: |
  Research into self-hosted project management platforms as alternatives to SaaS PM
  tools like JIRA, Asana, Monday, and Trello. Analysis covers 8 platforms across
  three tiers: lightweight task boards (WeKan, Vikunja, Focalboard), full-featured
  agile platforms (Plane, Taiga, Worklenz), and enterprise-grade systems (OpenProject,
  Redmine).

  Key drivers for self-hosting: data sovereignty, compliance requirements, vendor
  lock-in avoidance, and cost control at scale. Platforms divide by methodology
  (Agile vs Kanban vs Traditional), technical complexity (Docker-first vs complex),
  and enterprise readiness.

  Status: S1 Complete (November 7, 2025)
  Next: S2 Comprehensive Discovery with performance benchmarks, feature matrix,
  and TCO analysis.

# Notes
notes: |
  1.131 covers self-hosted project management platforms as alternatives to SaaS PM
  tools like JIRA, Asana, Monday, Trello.

  **Key Distinction from SaaS PM (future 3.XXX research)**:
  - 1.131: Self-hosted platforms YOU run and control
  - 3.XXX: Vendor-operated SaaS where THEY run infrastructure

  **Platform Tiers**:
  1. Modern full-featured (Plane, Taiga, Worklenz) - 2020+, Docker-first, modern UX
  2. Enterprise-grade (OpenProject, Redmine) - Mature, comprehensive, complex
  3. Lightweight (WeKan, Vikunja, Focalboard) - Simple Kanban/task boards

  **Market Context (2024-2025)**:
  - Renewed self-hosting interest (privacy regulations, SaaS cost escalation)
  - Docker-first deployment simplifies self-hosting
  - Modern open source matches/exceeds proprietary UX (Plane vs JIRA)
  - Methodology flexibility (hybrid Scrum/Kanban/Waterfall) now expected

  **Research Structure** (MPSE v3.0):
  - S1 (Rapid): ✅ Platform landscape (8 platforms), selection framework
  - S2 (Comprehensive): 🔲 Feature matrix, performance, TCO, security
  - S3 (Need-Driven): 🔲 Use case patterns, architecture decisions
  - S4 (Strategic): 🔲 Vendor viability, community health, lock-in mitigation

  **IMPORTANT**: Generic research only - no application-specific analysis
