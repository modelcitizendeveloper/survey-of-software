  Research on flashcard system integration patterns for language learning.
  Two distinct paths: generate Anki decks for existing users vs build custom
  flashcard interface with full control.

use_case: |
  Primary: Deliver spaced repetition flashcards for language learning
  - Path A: Generate Anki decks (leverage 50M+ user ecosystem)
  - Path B: Build custom flashcard interface (full UX control)

  Critical decision: Anki export vs standalone system vs hybrid approach.

libraries_to_evaluate:
  anki_integration:
    - genanki: Programmatic Anki deck generation (no Anki installation required)
    - ankipandas: Analyze Anki databases with pandas
    - AnkiConnect: Live integration with Anki desktop (requires Anki running)
    - Anki pylib: Direct database access (low-level)
  custom_systems:
    - Build from scratch with FSRS (1.141)
    - Web-based flashcard frameworks
    - Mobile-first patterns

evaluation_criteria:
  - Installation complexity (user friction)
  - Data portability (vendor lock-in)
  - UX control (custom interface vs Anki UI)
  - Cross-platform (web, mobile, desktop)
  - Maintenance burden (library stability)
  - Migration path (Anki → custom or vice versa)

key_questions:
  - Anki export: Good enough for 90% of language learners?
  - Custom UI: Worth the engineering investment?
  - Hybrid approach: Best of both worlds or complexity nightmare?
  - Data format: Anki .apkg vs SQLite vs JSON?

integration_relationships:
  enabled_by:
    - code: "1.141"
      title: Spaced Repetition Algorithms
      reason: FSRS provides scheduling algorithm
    - code: "1.140"
      title: Classical Language Libraries
      reason: Provides content (Latin declensions, conjugations)
  enables:
    - code: "1.148"
      title: Morphological Analysis Libraries
      reason: Flashcard system delivers multi-language content

strategic_value:
  - Foundation for language learning application
  - Critical UX decision (Anki ecosystem vs custom)
  - Validates Path 1 (self-operated) delivery mechanism
  - Determines development scope (integration vs full build)

s3_focus: |
  CRITICAL: S3 must evaluate TWO distinct scenarios:

  Scenario 1: "Create flashcards for existing Anki users"
  - User already has Anki installed
  - Wants to import Latin/Japanese/Russian decks
  - Expects Anki's UI, mobile sync, ecosystem
  - Success = clean .apkg export, minimal friction

  Scenario 2: "Build software with custom interface"
  - User wants dedicated language learning app
  - Custom UX optimized for morphology learning
  - No Anki dependency, runs in browser/mobile
  - Success = full control, integrated experience

  Key trade-off: Anki's 50M user ecosystem vs custom UX control.

key_findings:
  - genanki is clear winner: 22× more popular than alternatives (33,970 vs 1,548 downloads/month)
  - Simple API for programmatic .apkg generation (no Anki installation needed)
  - MIT license, stable (v0.13.1), 1,492 GitHub stars
  - Media support (audio, images), GUID management for updates
  - AnkiConnect too complex (requires Anki running), ankipandas read-only

recommendation: Use genanki package (pip install genanki)

discovery_method: S1-only
completion_notes: |
  S1 rapid discovery sufficient - popularity signal decisive (22× leader).
  genanki only viable library for creating Anki decks programmatically.

  Alternatives:
  - AnkiConnect: Complex (requires Anki running + add-on install)
  - ankipandas: Wrong tool (read-only analysis, cannot create decks)

  Custom flashcard system comparison (Anki export vs build-your-own) belongs
  in applications/ level analysis, not library research.

notes: |
  Second consecutive research where S1 alone sufficient due to clear popularity winner.

  Pattern: When ecosystem converges on solution (genanki 22×, FSRS 20-47×),
  S2-S4 add limited value. Library landscape is mature and stable.
