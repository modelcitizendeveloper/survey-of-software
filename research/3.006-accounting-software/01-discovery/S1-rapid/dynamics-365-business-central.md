## Decision Framework: Business Central vs Alternatives

**Choose Business Central when:**
- Already invested in Microsoft ecosystem (Office 365, Azure)
- Need ERP capabilities (accounting + operations + manufacturing)
- Want Power Platform for custom apps and workflows
- Budget allows $25K-100K/year for 10-50 users
- Have access to Microsoft partners for implementation

**Choose Sage Intacct when:**
- Accounting is primary focus (not full ERP)
- Not tied to Microsoft ecosystem
- Professional services or SaaS company
- Want best-in-class accounting vs integrated ERP

**Choose NetSuite when:**
- E-commerce is core business
- Multi-subsidiary complexity (5+ entities)
- Need proven cloud ERP with 20+ year track record
- Budget allows $50K-250K+/year

**Stay with QuickBooks/Xero when:**
- Revenue <$5M, users <20
- Simple accounting needs
- Don't need manufacturing or complex operations
- Want $3K-15K/year budget

## Graduation Path

**When businesses choose Business Central:**
- Outgrowing QuickBooks/Xero
- Revenue $5M-$100M
- Need integrated ERP (not just accounting)
- Already using Microsoft products
- 10-300 employees

**When to graduate FROM Business Central:**
- Revenue exceeds $100M-$200M
- Need enterprise-grade ERP (SAP, Oracle ERP Cloud)
- Industry-specific requirements not met
- Outgrow Business Central scalability

**Next step:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance (larger enterprise) or SAP

## Notes

- Formerly known as Dynamics NAV (Navision)
- Rebranded as Dynamics 365 Business Central in 2018
- Cloud-first but on-premise option still exists
- Strong in manufacturing, distribution, professional services
- Requires certified Microsoft Dynamics partner for implementation
- App Source marketplace for extensions and industry solutions
- November 2025 price increase (first in 5+ years)
- Strong for businesses already on Microsoft cloud stack
- Less suitable if not using Microsoft ecosystem

## Accounting-Specific Considerations

If evaluating primarily for **accounting capabilities**:
- Accounting features are comprehensive but not as deep as Sage Intacct
- Multi-entity consolidation good but not as sophisticated as NetSuite/Intacct
- Best value when you need accounting + operations (inventory, manufacturing)
- If 80%+ accounting-focused, Sage Intacct may be better fit
- If 50/50 accounting + operations + already on Microsoft, Business Central makes sense
