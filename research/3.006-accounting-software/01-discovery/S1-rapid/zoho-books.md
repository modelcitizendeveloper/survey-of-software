## Competitive Position

- **vs QuickBooks:** Lower cost, better Zoho integration; smaller ecosystem

## Integration Highlights

## Graduation Path

**When to outgrow Zoho Books:**
- Need features outside Zoho ecosystem
- Accountant requires QuickBooks/Xero specifically
- Multi-entity consolidation becomes complex
- Revenue exceeds $10M or need mid-market features
- Zoho ecosystem becomes limiting

**Next step:** QuickBooks/Xero (if leaving Zoho), Zoho One (full Zoho suite), or Sage Intacct/NetSuite (mid-market)

## Notes

- Part of larger Zoho One ecosystem (40+ business apps)
- Strong in India, growing internationally
- Free tier is generous for very small businesses
- Value proposition strongest when using multiple Zoho products
- Mobile app available but less polished than Xero
- Good option for cost-conscious businesses willing to learn the platform
