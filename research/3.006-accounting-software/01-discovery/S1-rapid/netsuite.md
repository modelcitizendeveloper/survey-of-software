- Rarely - NetSuite scales to $1B+ revenue
- Only if need industry-specific ERP (e.g., SAP for automotive)
- Or if acquired by company on different ERP platform

## Notes

- First cloud ERP (founded 1998)
- SuiteSuccess methodology for faster implementations
- Strong in retail, wholesale distribution, software/SaaS, manufacturing
- Annual subscription model
- Requires NetSuite partner for implementation
- Customization via SuiteScript, SuiteFlow, SuiteBundler
- Active user community (SuiteWorld conference)
- Positioned as "grow with" platform (mid-market to enterprise)

## NetSuite Accounting Module Specifically

If you're evaluating NetSuite **primarily for accounting**, consider:
- Accounting capabilities comparable to Sage Intacct
- Multi-entity consolidation excellent
- Financial reporting robust
- But you're paying for full ERP whether you use it or not
- If 80%+ accounting-focused, Sage Intacct likely better fit
- If 50/50 accounting + operational needs, NetSuite makes sense
