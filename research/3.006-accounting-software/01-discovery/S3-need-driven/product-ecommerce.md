**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025

## Scenario 7: Shopify Store ($250K Revenue, Solo Owner)

**Business Profile:**
- E-commerce clothing store on Shopify
- $250K annual revenue
- Solo owner + 1 part-time helper
- 500 orders/month
- Needs: Shopify integration, COGS tracking, sales tax, inventory sync

**Primary Recommendation: QuickBooks Online Plus ($85/mo)**

**Rationale:**
- Native Shopify integration (automatic order sync)
- Inventory tracking included (COGS calculation)
- Sales tax automation
- Most e-commerce accountants know QuickBooks
- Scales as business grows

**Runner-Up: Xero Growing ($42/mo) + Shopify Integration**
- Half the price of QuickBooks
- Good Shopify integration via apps
- Unlimited users
- Con: Inventory management less robust

**Budget Alternative: Zoho Books Professional ($50/mo)**
- Shopify integration available
- Inventory tracking included
- Lower cost than QuickBooks
- Con: Smaller ecosystem, less accountant familiarity

**Red Flags:**
- Don't use Wave (no inventory management)
- Don't use FreshBooks (no inventory tracking)

**Migration Path:**
- QuickBooks Plus: $250K-$5M revenue
- At $5M+: Consider NetSuite (e-commerce ERP with SuiteCommerce)

---

## Scenario 8: Multi-Channel E-Commerce ($2M Revenue, Amazon + Shopify + eBay)

**Business Profile:**
- Multi-channel e-commerce
- $2M annual revenue
- Selling on Amazon, Shopify, eBay, Walmart Marketplace
- 5,000 orders/month across channels
- 10 employees (warehouse, customer service, admin)
- Needs: Multi-channel inventory, COGS by channel, consolidated reporting

**Primary Recommendation: QuickBooks Online Advanced ($275/mo) + Multi-Channel Integration**

**Rationale:**
- Handles 25 users (room to grow from 10)
- Strong multi-channel integrations (A2X for Amazon, etc.)
- Inventory tracking across channels
- Advanced reporting
- Most affordable option for this complexity

**Runner-Up: NetSuite + SuiteCommerce**
- Full e-commerce ERP
- Multi-channel native
- Warehouse management
- ~$50K-80K/year
- Overkill at $2M but scales to $50M+

**Budget Alternative: Xero Established + Dear Inventory**
- Xero: $80/mo + Dear Inventory: $249/mo = $329/mo total
- Better inventory than native Xero
- Multi-channel support
- Con: Two systems to manage

**Red Flags:**
- Don't wait too long to upgrade (QuickBooks struggles at 10K+ orders/month)
- Don't jump to NetSuite too early (expensive at $2M revenue)

**Migration Path:**
- QuickBooks Advanced: $2M-$10M revenue
- NetSuite: $10M+ revenue (or sooner if warehouse complexity demands it)

---

## Scenario 9: Wholesale Distribution ($10M Revenue, 25 Employees, B2B)

**Business Profile:**
- Wholesale distributor (B2B)
- $10M annual revenue
- 25 employees
- 500 SKUs, multi-warehouse (2 locations)
- Complex pricing (volume discounts, customer-specific pricing)
- Needs: Advanced inventory, warehouse management, B2B pricing

**Primary Recommendation: NetSuite ($80K-120K/year)**

**Rationale:**
- Advanced inventory and warehouse management
- Multi-location inventory tracking
- Customer-specific pricing rules
- Order management for B2B
- Scales to $100M+
- Distribution industry focus

**Runner-Up: Sage Intacct + Inventory Module**
- $40K-60K/year (cheaper than NetSuite)
- Good inventory capabilities
- Strong accounting (better than NetSuite)
- Con: Warehouse management not as deep as NetSuite

**Why NOT QuickBooks:**
- QuickBooks Advanced caps at 25 users (you're at limit)
- Inventory tracking too basic for wholesale
- No warehouse management features
- Will struggle with transaction volume

**Red Flags:**
- Don't delay NetSuite migration (complexity increases with scale)
- Don't try to make QuickBooks work (will hit walls quickly)

**Migration Path:**
- NetSuite is likely endpoint platform
- Only upgrade to Oracle ERP Cloud at $100M+ revenue

## Scenario 10: Retail Chain (5 Locations, $3M Revenue, Brick-and-Mortar)

**Business Profile:**
- Retail clothing stores
- 5 physical locations
- $3M annual revenue combined
- POS systems at each location
- Needs: Multi-location inventory, POS integration, consolidated reporting

**Primary Recommendation: QuickBooks Online Plus ($85/mo) + POS Integration**

**Rationale:**
- Multi-location tracking (classes for each store)
- Integrates with POS systems (Square, Shopify POS, Lightspeed)
- Consolidated reporting across locations
- Inventory tracking
- Affordable for $3M revenue

**Runner-Up: Lightspeed Retail + Accounting Integration**
- Lightspeed Retail POS includes inventory and accounting features
- Built for multi-location retail
- $69-189/mo per location = $345-945/mo total
- Better than QuickBooks for retail-specific needs

**NetSuite Option (If Scaling Fast):**
- If planning to grow to 20+ locations or $10M+ revenue
- NetSuite SuiteRetail module
- ~$60K-100K/year
- Scales to hundreds of locations

**Red Flags:**
- Don't use Wave or FreshBooks (no multi-location inventory)
- Don't use separate QuickBooks files per location (consolidation nightmare)

**Migration Path:**
- QuickBooks Plus: 1-10 locations, <$5M revenue
- NetSuite: 10+ locations or $10M+ revenue

## Scenario 11: Amazon FBA Seller ($5M Revenue, Private Label)

**Business Profile:**
- Amazon FBA private label seller
- $5M annual revenue
- 50 SKUs
- Manufacturing in China, fulfillment via FBA
- Needs: Amazon integration, COGS tracking, multi-currency (USD + CNY), inventory valuation

**Primary Recommendation: QuickBooks Online Advanced + A2X**

**Rationale:**
- A2X (Amazon integration app) splits settlement files perfectly
- Multi-currency support (QuickBooks Advanced)
- COGS and inventory tracking
- Most Amazon sellers use QuickBooks + A2X
- Accountants familiar with this stack

**Runner-Up: Xero + A2X**
- A2X also integrates with Xero
- Multi-currency on Established tier ($80/mo)
- Unlimited users
- Total: $80/mo (Xero) + $49/mo (A2X) = $129/mo vs $275+$49=$324/mo QB

**Mid-Market Option: NetSuite**
- If scaling to $20M+ revenue
- Native Amazon integration
- Advanced inventory and multi-currency
- ~$60K-100K/year

**Red Flags:**
- Don't use QuickBooks without A2X (manual Amazon reconciliation is nightmare)
- Don't use Wave (no multi-currency, poor Amazon support)

**Migration Path:**
- QuickBooks/Xero + A2X: $1M-$10M revenue
- NetSuite: $10M+ revenue (or sooner if international expansion)

## Scenario 12: Manufacturer ($15M Revenue, 75 Employees, Made-to-Order)

**Business Profile:**
- Custom furniture manufacturer
- $15M annual revenue
- 75 employees
- Made-to-order production
- Needs: Job costing, work-in-progress tracking, BOM (bill of materials), manufacturing

**Primary Recommendation: NetSuite + Manufacturing Module ($120K-180K/year)**

**Rationale:**
- Full manufacturing ERP
- Work order tracking and job costing
- Bill of materials (BOM) management
- Inventory (raw materials + WIP + finished goods)
- Production scheduling
- Scales to $100M+

**Runner-Up: Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium ($110/user/mo × 75 = $99K/year)**
- Manufacturing capabilities included in Premium tier
- Microsoft ecosystem benefits
- Slightly cheaper than NetSuite
- Good for manufacturers

**Why NOT Accounting-Only Software:**
- Sage Intacct: Can do job costing but not full manufacturing
- QuickBooks: No true manufacturing features
- Would need separate MRP/ERP system + accounting (integration complexity)

**Red Flags:**
- Don't try to use QuickBooks for manufacturing (will fail)
- Don't use Sage Intacct without understanding manufacturing limitations

**Migration Path:**
- NetSuite or Dynamics 365 are endpoint platforms for manufacturers
- Only upgrade to SAP at $500M+ or industry-specific needs
