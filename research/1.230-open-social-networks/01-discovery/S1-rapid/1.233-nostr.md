**Category**: Open Social Networks (1.230-239)
**Date**: December 22, 2025
**Methodology**: MPSE v3.0 S1 Deep-Dive Research

## Executive Summary

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is an open protocol for decentralized, censorship-resistant social networking. Created by fiatjaf in 2020, Nostr uses cryptographic key pairs as identities and distributes content through stateless relays.

### Key Facts

- **Created**: 2020 by fiatjaf
- **Scale**: 43.5M pubkeys, 1.18M active users, 800+ relays, 140+ clients
- **Funding**: Jack Dorsey donated $10M to Nostr development (2025)
- **Key Feature**: Lightning Network integration for micropayments (zaps)
- **Main Challenge**: Key management UX

---

## 1. Protocol Overview

### 1.1 Architecture

Nostr uses a simple client-relay design:

**Components**:
- **Clients**: Applications that create, sign, and publish content
- **Relays**: Stateless servers that receive, store, and broadcast events
- **Events**: The fundamental data structure for all information
- **Keys**: Public/private key pairs (secp256k1) as identities

**Key Properties**:
- No single entity controls the network
- Users can switch relays without losing identity
- Natural load distribution through redundancy

### 1.2 Relays

Relays are independently operated servers that:
- Store events published by clients
- Broadcast events via WebSocket connections
- Can implement custom moderation policies
- Support free, paid, or private models

**Relay Types**:
- **Public**: Open to all (625+ exist)
- **Paid**: Charge for writes (reduces spam)
- **Private**: Restricted access

### 1.3 NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)

NIPs standardize the protocol:
- **Mandatory NIPs**: Essential (NIP-01)
- **Optional NIPs**: Add features without breaking compatibility
- **Draft NIPs**: Under discussion

### 1.4 Cryptographic Identity

- **Public Key**: 32-byte hex, immutable identity
- **Private Key**: 32-byte hex, signs all events
- Every event is cryptographically signed
- No relay or authority can revoke identity

---

## 2. Key Differentiators

### 2.1 Simplicity
- NIP-01 specification is minimal
- One unified data structure (events)
- JSON messaging, WebSocket communication
- Low barrier for developers

### 2.2 Censorship Resistance
- Decentralized relays (no single point of control)
- Self-sovereign keys (cannot be revoked)
- Content replication across relays
- Users can run personal relays

### 2.3 No Accounts Required
- Identity from cryptographic keys
- No email, KYC, or verification
- Complete user autonomy
- Trade-off: User responsible for key security

## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 Event Structure

```json
{
  "id": "sha256_hash",
  "pubkey": "32_byte_hex_public_key",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "event_id"],
    ["p", "pubkey"],
    ["t", "hashtag"]
  ],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "64_byte_hex_signature"
}
```

### 3.2 Event Kinds

| Kind | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **0** | User Metadata (profile) |
| **1** | Short Text Notes |
| **3** | Contact List (follows) |
| **5** | Event Deletion |
| **6** | Repost |
| **7** | Reaction |
| **9735** | Zap (Lightning payment) |

### 3.3 Relay Communication

**Client → Relay**:
- `["EVENT", <event>]` - Publish
- `["REQ", "sub_id", <filters>]` - Subscribe
- `["CLOSE", "sub_id"]` - Unsubscribe

**Relay → Client**:
- `["EVENT", "sub_id", <event>]` - Deliver
- `["EOSE", "sub_id"]` - End of stored events
- `["OK", "event_id", true/false, "msg"]` - Confirmation

## 4. NIP Ecosystem

### 4.1 NIP-01: Basic Protocol
- Event structure and validation
- Relay communication
- Signature verification (Schnorr on secp256k1)

### 4.2 NIP-05: DNS Identifiers
- Maps pubkeys to email-like identifiers
- `alice@example.com` verified via `.well-known/nostr.json`
- Bridges gap to mainstream UX

### 4.3 NIP-57: Lightning Zaps
- Bitcoin micropayments for content
- July 2025: 5.1M zaps = $20.67M USD
- Creates economic incentives for creators and relays

### 4.4 NIP-07: Browser Extensions
- Secure key management via extensions
- Private key never leaves extension
- Examples: Alby, nos2x
