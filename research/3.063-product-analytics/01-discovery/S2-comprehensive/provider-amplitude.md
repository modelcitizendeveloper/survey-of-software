2. **Cost at Scale**: MTU-based pricing can become very expensive ($50K+/year common)
3. **Free Tier Constraints**: 100K MTUs sufficient for small apps but limits growth
4. **Feature Gating**: Best capabilities (Experiment, Recommend) require Growth/Enterprise
5. **Setup Complexity**: Requires careful event taxonomy planning and governance
6. **Overkill for Simple Use Cases**: Too complex for basic funnel and retention analysis

## Competitive Positioning

- **vs Mixpanel**: More powerful for behavioral analysis; Mixpanel easier for self-serve teams
- **vs PostHog**: More mature enterprise features; PostHog more affordable and open-source
- **vs Heap**: Manual instrumentation required; Heap offers automatic capture

6. Teams running extensive A/B testing and experimentation programs

## Not Recommended For

1. Early-stage startups with limited budgets (<$1K/month)
2. Small teams without analytical expertise (use Mixpanel instead)
3. Companies prioritizing ease of use over analytical depth
4. Organizations requiring automatic event capture (use Heap)
5. Teams wanting self-hosted or open-source solutions (use PostHog)
6. Simple use cases needing basic funnels and retention only
