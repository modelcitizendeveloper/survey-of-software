### 4. Pricing Analysis Framework

**Volume Tiers for Comparison:**
- **Startup**: 10K events/month (early validation)
- **Small Team**: 100K events/month (growing product)
- **Growth Stage**: 1M events/month (established product)
- **Scale-Up**: 10M events/month (high-growth company)
- **Enterprise**: 100M+ events/month (mature product)

**Pricing Dimensions:**
- Base monthly/annual cost
- Cost per additional event/MTU/session
- Volume discount thresholds
- Free tier limitations
- Enterprise features and pricing

### 5. Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario A: Early-Stage Startup**
- Budget: <$500/month
- Volume: 10-100K events/month
- Needs: Basic funnels, retention, simple dashboards
- Team: 2-5 non-technical users

**Scenario B: Growing SaaS Product**
- Budget: $500-2000/month
- Volume: 500K-2M events/month
- Needs: Advanced segmentation, A/B testing, custom reports
- Team: 10-20 mixed technical/business users

**Scenario C: Enterprise B2B Platform**
- Budget: $5K-20K/month
- Volume: 10M-50M events/month
