# S1 RAPID DISCOVERY Approach

## Experiment: 3.050 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

### Methodology: Popularity-First Discovery

**Goal:** Identify the most popular PaaS providers for deploying Python/Flask web applications, including PythonAnywhere (current QRCards host).

**Research Strategy:**
1. Web search for "best platform as a service 2024 2025"
2. Web search for "best PaaS for Python Flask apps 2024 2025"
3. Comparative analysis of leading platforms (Heroku, Render, Railway, Fly.io)
4. Pricing and feature investigation for each discovered provider
5. Position assessment for PythonAnywhere in the competitive landscape

**Selection Criteria:**
- Market share and popularity indicators
- Developer community recommendations
- GitHub stars / community size
- Free tier availability (important for experimentation)
- Native Python/Flask support
- Ease of deployment

**Discovery Sources:**
- TechTarget PaaS provider reviews
- Developer community comparisons (DEV.to, Medium, Hacker News)
- Official documentation and pricing pages
- Real-world deployment guides and tutorials

**Time Investment:** 5-7 minutes of rapid research

**Output:** 10 provider profiles covering pricing, strengths, and market positioning

## Key Findings Summary

### Market Landscape
The PaaS market in 2024-2025 is dominated by major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for enterprise use, but developer-focused platforms have emerged as popular alternatives for small to medium web applications.

### Free Tier Changes
Significant shift in 2022-2024: Both Heroku and Railway eliminated their generous free tiers, while Render maintains a limited free tier. Fly.io also removed its free tier in October 2024. This creates opportunities for providers with free tiers (PythonAnywhere, Render).

### Python/Flask Support
All modern PaaS providers support Python/Flask, but ease of deployment and Python-specific features vary significantly. PythonAnywhere specializes in Python, while others are more general-purpose.

### Discovered Providers (10 total)
1. Render - Leading Heroku alternative with free tier
2. Railway - Modern developer experience, pay-as-you-go
3. Fly.io - Edge computing, global distribution
4. Heroku - Established leader, premium pricing
5. PythonAnywhere - Python-specialized, beginner-friendly
6. Vercel - Serverless focus, Python support
7. DigitalOcean App Platform - Traditional cloud provider entry
