  confidence_overall: "Very High (90-95%)"

key_findings:
  - "WebAssembly-based solutions (Pyodide, JupyterLite, PyScript) are strategic winners for 5+ year horizon"
  - "JupyterLite has highest viability confidence (9.5/10) due to Linux Foundation backing"
  - "JavaScript transpilers (Brython, Skulpt) face declining strategic relevance"
  - "Skulpt is obsolete (Python 2 EOL) - immediate migration required for existing deployments"
  - "No universal 'best' solution - choice depends on use case requirements (notebooks vs tutorials vs widgets)"
  - "Most computational widgets DON'T need Python - JavaScript is 3000x smaller and 200x faster"
  - "Security requires multi-layer defense: Web Workers + timeouts + memory limits + network filtering"
  - "Scientific computing (NumPy/Pandas) requires Pyodide-based solutions (Pyodide/JupyterLite/PyScript)"

recommendations_by_context:
  data_science_notebooks: "JupyterLite (Linux Foundation backing, full Jupyter UX, proven at 500k-student scale)"
  scientific_computing: "Pyodide or PyScript (NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib support)"
  interactive_tutorials: "PyScript <py-repl> (zero-config, beginner-friendly, 4s startup)"
  embedded_repls: "PyScript or raw Pyodide (professional REPL UI vs minimal bundle)"
  computational_widgets: "JavaScript FIRST (3000x smaller), Pyodide only if NumPy/SciPy required"
  secure_code_execution: "Pyodide + multi-layer defense (Web Workers, timeouts, memory limits)"
  mobile_first_apps: "PyScript (MicroPython) or Brython (<1MB bundles, <1s startup)"
  rapid_prototyping: "PyScript (HTML-first, dual runtime flexibility)"
  custom_integration: "Pyodide (maximum control, 6.4MB core)"
  legacy_python_2: "Skulpt (migration to Python 3 required - DO NOT adopt for new projects)"

anti_recommendations:
  - "Don't use Skulpt for new projects (Python 2 EOL, obsolete)"
  - "Don't use browser Python for simple calculators (JavaScript is 3000x smaller)"
  - "Don't use Pyodide/JupyterLite for mobile-first apps (6-15MB bundles, 3-12s startup)"
  - "Don't use PyScript for mission-critical production (beta status, evolving API)"
  - "Don't use Brython for data science (no NumPy/Pandas support)"
  - "Don't rely on Pyodide alone for security (requires defensive engineering)"
