# About the Survey of Software

> **Stop guessing which library to use. Consult the map.**

Pre-done library research across dozens of categories. Use it to decide faster, don't redo months of research.

## The Problem: An Unmapped Landscape

You're building something. You need a graph algorithm library. Or a JSON parser. Or an LLM wrapper.

**What do you do?**

- Google it? (Get marketing pages and outdated blog posts)
- Ask Claude to pick one? (Roll the dice on what it knows)
- Use the first result on PyPI? (Hope it's maintained)
- Stop everything and research for hours? (There goes your sprint)

**The software library landscape is unmapped.** Each library has its own documentation, but there's no systematic survey across categories. You're on your own to figure out what exists and which one to pick.

## The Solution: Systematic Triangulation

Like the Great Trigonometric Survey of India mapped an entire subcontinent through systematic measurement, **we're triangulating the software library landscape**—one category at a time.

**I needed these measurements for my own projects.** Now you don't have to do the research.

## What We Catalog

### ✅ In Scope: General-Purpose Software Components

- **Algorithm libraries** - Sorting, graph algorithms, compression
- **Data processing tools** - JSON parsing, serialization, streaming
- **ML frameworks** - PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX
- **Infrastructure components** - Databases, messaging, caching
- **Development tools** - Testing, logging, monitoring
- **Speech & vision** - OCR, TTS, ASR with multilingual support
- **NLP & text processing** - Summarization, spell-checking, CJK-specific tools

**The components you assemble into larger systems.**

### ❌ Out of Scope

- Application-specific integrations
- Vertical-specific solutions (e.g., language learning apps)
- Business logic implementations
- Custom SaaS platforms

**The buildings built from components.**

## The 4PS Methodology: Four Ways to See the Same Landscape

Each research piece uses **4PS - The Four-Pass Survey**, revealing different aspects of the solution space:

### S1: Rapid Discovery
**When:** You need an answer *now*
**Philosophy:** "Popular libraries exist for a reason"
**Approach:** Speed-focused, ecosystem-driven
**Output:** Quick comparison table, 5-10 minute read

### S2: Comprehensive Analysis
**When:** You need to know *everything*
**Philosophy:** "Understand the entire solution space before choosing"
**Approach:** Feature matrices, deep comparisons, optimization-focused
**Output:** Complete technical analysis

### S3: Need-Driven Discovery
**When:** You know *exactly what you're building*
**Philosophy:** "Start with requirements, find exact-fit solutions"
**Approach:** Scenario-based selection, validation-oriented
**Output:** Requirement → library mapping

### S4: Strategic Selection
**When:** You're making *architectural decisions*
**Philosophy:** "Think long-term and consider broader context"
**Approach:** Maintenance, team expertise, ecosystem fit, vendor stability
**Output:** Strategic insights for multi-year choices

**Why four perspectives?** Different discovery approaches reveal different optimal solutions. A library that's "best" for rapid prototyping might be wrong for production. Strategic constraints might override technical superiority. **Single-methodology discovery misses better paths.**

### Supplementary: Explainers
**When:** You're new to the domain
**Philosophy:** "Make it accessible to everyone"
**Approach:** Domain fundamentals without assuming expertise
**Output:** Foundational understanding

*Note: Explainers are supplementary content, not one of the four passes. They provide domain context when needed.*

## Quality Standards & Limitations

### Research-Grade Confidence (Not Consumer Reports Certainty)

This is strategic guidance, not absolute truth:
- **S1 Rapid:** 70-80% confidence (speed-optimized)
- **S2 Comprehensive:** 80-90% confidence (depth-optimized)
- **S3 Need-Driven:** 75-85% confidence (context-specific)
- **S4 Strategic:** 60-70% confidence (forward-looking)

**Why not 95%+ certainty?** Because library ecosystems evolve constantly, and deep certainty requires hands-on experience with production workloads. This research gets you **directionally correct** so you can make informed validation decisions.

### Information Decay

Library ecosystems change:
- Pricing models shift
- Features get added
- New competitors emerge
- Vendors pivot or get acquired
- Maintenance status changes

**Estimated accuracy:**
- **At publication:** 70-80%
- **12 months:** 50-70%
- **36 months:** <30%

**Treat this as a living map, not a textbook.** The research guides investigation—you validate with hands-on testing.
