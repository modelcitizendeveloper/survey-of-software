## Disclaimer & Limitations

### AI-Generated Research

This research is produced using AI systems (primarily Claude Code). While all published content is human-reviewed, AI-generated analysis may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information.

### No Warranties or Guarantees

This research is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. We make no guarantees regarding:

- **Accuracy** — Library features, performance claims, or comparisons may be incorrect
- **Security** — Recommended libraries may contain vulnerabilities or become compromised
- **Maintenance** — Libraries may be abandoned, archived, or deprecated
- **Compatibility** — Integration claims may not match your specific environment
- **Licensing** — License information may be incomplete or change without notice

### Use at Your Own Risk

**You are responsible for:**
- Verifying all claims before implementation
- Security auditing of any libraries you adopt
- Testing compatibility with your systems
- Monitoring for vulnerabilities and updates
- Complying with all applicable licenses

**We are not liable for:**
- Security breaches from recommended libraries
- System failures or data loss
- License violations or legal issues
- Production incidents or downtime
- Any damages resulting from use of this research

### Information Decay

Library ecosystems evolve rapidly. Research accuracy degrades over time:
- **At publication:** 70-80% estimated accuracy
- **After 12 months:** 50-70% estimated accuracy
- **After 36 months:** <30% estimated accuracy

**Always verify current information from primary sources.**

### Caveat Lector

This is research guidance, not gospel truth. Treat it as a starting point for your own investigation, not a substitute for due diligence. The responsibility for evaluating and vetting software for your use case rests entirely with you.
