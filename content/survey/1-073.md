        forecast = model.predict(future)

        return forecast[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']]
```

#### **Advanced Multi-Model Pipeline**:
```python
# Darts-based ensemble approach
from darts import TimeSeries
from darts.models import Prophet, ARIMA, ExponentialSmoothing
from darts.utils.utils import ModelMode

class EnsembleForecaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = [
            Prophet(),
            ARIMA(p=1, d=1, q=1),
            ExponentialSmoothing()
        ]

    def train(self, series):
        for model in self.models:
            model.fit(series)

    def forecast(self, n):
        forecasts = [model.predict(n) for model in self.models]
        # Simple ensemble average
        ensemble = sum(forecasts) / len(forecasts)
        return ensemble
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

#### **Overfitting Complex Models**:
```python
# BAD: Using deep learning for simple seasonal data
# BAD: Complex ensemble when Prophet would suffice
# BAD: Manual feature engineering when auto methods work

# GOOD: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
# Simple case → Prophet
# Complex case → Darts with backtesting
# Research case → statsmodels or sktime
```

#### **Ignoring Data Quality**:
```python
# BAD: Feeding raw data without validation
# BAD: Ignoring outliers and missing values
# BAD: No trend/seasonality analysis before modeling

# GOOD: Data quality pipeline first
def prepare_time_series(data):
    # Check for missing values
    # Identify and handle outliers
    # Validate temporal consistency
    # Analyze trend and seasonality
    return clean_data
