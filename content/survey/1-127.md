# Financial Simulation Explained - A Practical Guide

**Audience**: Tech founders, data scientists new to finance, business users considering Python for financial modeling

**Goal**: Demystify financial simulation, explain when you need it, what it offers vs spreadsheets/SaaS, and clarify common terminology

---

## 1. What is Financial Simulation?

**Simple Definition**: Financial simulation is **using computer programs to model financial scenarios** - from simple cash flow projections to complex derivatives pricing.

**Three Levels**:

1. **Basic** (Spreadsheet level): "If revenue grows 10%, what happens to cash?"
2. **Intermediate** (Programming level): "Model 1,000 revenue scenarios with statistical distributions"
3. **Advanced** (Quant level): "Price a European call option using Black-Scholes with stochastic volatility"

**This research (1.127)** focuses on **Level 2 and 3** - using Python libraries (pandas, numpy-financial, QuantLib, etc.) for financial simulation beyond what Excel can handle.

---

## 2. When Do You Need Financial Simulation?

### 2.1 You DON'T Need It If...

- **Simple cash tracking**: "How much money do we have?" → Use accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)
- **Basic budgeting**: "Plan next year's expenses" → Use Excel or SaaS (3.004 research: Pulse, Finmark)
- **Monthly reporting**: "Revenue vs expenses this month" → Use accounting software reports

**Bottom line**: If **Excel works fine**, you don't need programming-based financial simulation.

---

### 2.2 You MIGHT Need It If...

**Trigger 1: Excel is Breaking**
- File size `>50` MB (crashes frequently)
- Formulas so complex you can't audit them
- Need to model `>100` scenarios (Excel too slow)
- Version control nightmare (email attachments, lost edits)

**Trigger 2: Need Advanced Analytics**
- **Forecasting**: Predict revenue 12 months ahead with seasonality
- **Monte Carlo**: Run 10,000 scenarios to quantify risk
- **Optimization**: Find optimal portfolio allocation, production schedule, pricing strategy

**Trigger 3: SaaS is Too Expensive**
- Cash flow SaaS quotes `>$800/month` (3.004 breakpoint: Causal, Mosaic)
- 10-year TCO favors DIY with libraries (S4 Strategic analysis)

**Trigger 4: SaaS Can't Do What You Need**
- Derivatives pricing (QuantLib required, no SaaS alternative)
- Bayesian uncertainty quantification (PyMC required)
- Custom models proprietary to your business

---

### 2.3 You DEFINITELY Need It If...

- **Quant finance**: Trading algorithms, derivatives pricing, portfolio risk
- **Actuarial work**: Insurance reserving, loss development triangles
- **Research**: Econometric modeling, Bayesian statistics
- **High-stakes decisions**: M&A modeling, capital allocation ($10M+ decisions)

---

## 3. Core Concepts (Finance 101 for Tech Folks)

### 3.1 Time Value of Money

**Concept**: **A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow** (because you can invest it and earn returns).

**Key Formula**: **NPV (Net Present Value)**
- Converts future cash flows to today's dollars
- Example: $100 in 1 year, assuming 10% discount rate:
  ```
  NPV = $100 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $90.91
  ```
- **Python**: `import numpy_financial as npf; npf.npv(0.10, [0, 100])`

**Why it matters**: Compare investments with different time horizons (buy equipment now vs hire person later)

---

### 3.2 Forecasting

**Concept**: **Predict future values** based on historical data.

**Two Types**:
1. **Extrapolation**: Extend historical trends (Prophet, statsmodels ARIMA)
   - Example: "Revenue grew 10%/year for 5 years → predict 10% next year"

2. **Causal**: Model relationships (statsmodels regression)
   - Example: "Revenue = f(marketing spend, seasonality, competitors)"

**Limitations**:
- **Cannot predict regime changes** (new competitor, pandemic, regulation)
- **Assumes past patterns continue** (often wrong in volatile markets)

**Python**: `from prophet import Prophet` (S1 library profile: business forecasting)

---

### 3.3 Monte Carlo Simulation

**Concept**: **Run thousands of scenarios** with randomness to quantify uncertainty.

**Example**: Revenue forecasting with uncertainty
- Pessimistic scenario (10% chance): Revenue = $800K
- Base case (50%): Revenue = $1M
- Optimistic (10%): Revenue = $1.3M

**Monte Carlo**: Run 10,000 simulations sampling from distribution → "95% confident revenue will be $850K-$1.2M"

**Why vs single forecast?**: Quantifies risk ("How bad could it get?") vs point estimate ("What do we expect?")

**Python**: `from scipy import stats; stats.norm.rvs(loc=1000000, scale=200000, size=10000)` (S1: scipy.stats)

---

### 3.4 Derivatives Pricing

**Concept**: Calculate **fair value of financial instruments** whose value derives from underlying assets (stocks, bonds, commodities).

**Examples**:
- **Option**: Right (not obligation) to buy Apple stock at $150 (current price $160) in 1 month → worth ~$10?
- **Swap**: Exchange fixed interest rate for floating → what's fair fixed rate?

**Models**:
- **Black-Scholes**: Options pricing (closed-form formula)
- **Binomial tree**: American options (numerical method)
- **Monte Carlo**: Path-dependent derivatives (simulations)

**Why complex?**: **Risk-neutral valuation**, **no-arbitrage pricing**, **stochastic calculus** (advanced math)

**Python**: `import QuantLib as ql` (S1: industrial-grade library, 100-hour learning curve)

---

### 3.5 Backtesting

**Concept**: **Test trading strategy on historical data** to see if it would have been profitable.

**Example**: "If I bought stocks when 20-day moving average crossed above 50-day MA, and sold when it crossed below, would I beat buy-and-hold?"

**Process**:
1. Define strategy (entry/exit rules, position sizing)
2. Run on historical price data (2010-2020)
3. Calculate returns, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
4. Compare to benchmark (S&P 500 buy-and-hold)

**Gotcha**: **Overfitting** (strategy works on historical data, fails on new data) - must validate on out-of-sample data

**Python**: `import vectorbt as vbt` (S1: backtesting engine, Numba-optimized)

---

### 3.6 Bayesian Inference

**Concept**: **Update beliefs based on evidence** using Bayes' theorem.

**Example**: Revenue growth estimation
- **Prior belief**: Growth rate = 10% (based on industry average)
- **New data**: Your company grew 15%, 12%, 18% last 3 years
- **Posterior belief**: Growth rate = 14% ± 3% (95% credible interval)

**Why vs normal statistics?**:
- **Quantifies uncertainty** (not just point estimate)
- **Incorporates prior knowledge** (industry benchmarks, expert opinion)
- **Probabilistic statements** ("80% chance growth `>10`%" vs p-value confusion)

**Cost**: **Computationally expensive** (MCMC sampling takes minutes-hours vs milliseconds for simple Monte Carlo)

**Python**: `import pymc as pm` (S1: 40-hour learning curve, requires Bayesian statistics knowledge)

---

## 4. Python vs Excel vs SaaS - When to Use What?

### 4.1 Excel (Spreadsheets)

**Best for**:
- Quick calculations (`<100` rows)
- Exploring data (pivot tables, charts)
- Sharing with non-technical people (everyone has Excel)
- One-time analysis

**Breaks down when**:
- File size `>50` MB (slow, crashes)
- Need version control (Git doesn't work well with .xlsx)
- Complex formulas (hard to audit, error-prone)
- Automation (manual refresh, copy-paste errors)

**Cost**: Microsoft 365 ($100-150/year/user)

**Learning curve**: 10-40 hours to proficiency (most people already know basics)

---

### 4.2 SaaS (Cash Flow Management Platforms)

**Best for**:
- No technical team (can't code)
- Collaboration (CFO, CEO, board need UI)
- Standard models (cash flow, budgeting, forecasting)
- SaaS cost `<$300/month` (cheaper than DIY)

**Breaks down when**:
- SaaS cost `>$800/month` (DIY with libraries cheaper - S4 Strategic analysis)
- Custom models (derivatives, Bayesian - no SaaS alternative)
- Data warehouse integration (SaaS limited integrations)
- Lock-in aversion (3.004: $3K-9K escape cost vs libraries $0)

**Cost**: $59-2,000/month (3.004 research: Pulse, Finmark, Jirav, Causal, Mosaic)

**Learning curve**: 5-20 hours (onboarding, training)

**Recommendation**: See **3.004 research** for SaaS evaluation

---

### 4.3 Python Libraries (This Research - 1.127)

**Best for**:
- SaaS cost `>$800/month` (10-year TCO breakeven)
- Custom models (derivatives, Bayesian, proprietary algorithms)
- Data warehouse integration (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Automation (scheduled runs, CI/CD pipelines)
- Zero lock-in (code is yours, data is yours)

**Breaks down when**:
- No technical team (training cost >SaaS cost)
- Need collaboration UI (notebooks less friendly than SaaS dashboards)
- Simple use case (Excel or cheap SaaS sufficient)

**Cost**: $11.4K-81.7K 3-year TCO depending on complexity (S2 TCO analysis)

**Learning curve**: 45-420 hours depending on library (S2 learning curve spectrum)

**Recommendation**: See **sections below** for library selection

---

## 5. Common Use Cases Explained

### 5.1 Cash Flow Modeling

**What**: Track money in/out, forecast runway, model scenarios

**Excel version**:
- Revenue, expenses by month
- Cumulative cash balance
- "What if revenue grows 20%?" → copy column, adjust formula

**Python version** (pandas + numpy-financial):
- Store cash flows in DataFrame (rows = time, columns = scenarios)
- Calculate NPV with `npf.npv(0.1, cash_flows)`
- Run 1,000 scenarios with scipy.stats (Monte Carlo)

**When to graduate Excel → Python**:
- Need `>50` scenarios (Excel too slow)
- Want version control (Git for code vs email for .xlsx)
- Automate monthly reporting (run script, not manual)

**Libraries**: pandas, numpy-financial (S1 profiles)

**3-Year TCO**: $11,430 (S2 analysis) vs SaaS Pulse $1,044, Finmark $7,200

**Recommendation**: Use SaaS (Pulse, Finmark) unless have dev team + need `>50` scenarios

---

### 5.2 Revenue Forecasting

**What**: Predict revenue 3-12 months ahead for budgeting, fundraising

**Excel version**:
- Linear trendline (=FORECAST())
- Average growth rate (=AVERAGE(B2:B13))

**Python version** (Prophet, statsmodels):
- Prophet: Automatic seasonality detection, handles holidays, missing data
- statsmodels: Regression with explanatory variables (marketing spend → revenue)

**When to graduate Excel → Python**:
- Need seasonality (monthly, quarterly patterns)
- Want confidence intervals ("80% confident revenue $900K-$1.1M")
- Causal relationships (model revenue = f(marketing, price, competitors))

**Libraries**: Prophet (extrapolation), statsmodels (causal regression) - S1 profiles

**3-Year TCO**: $22,860 (pandas + Prophet) vs SaaS Causal $28,800

**Recommendation**: Python competitive if have data scientist + 2+ years historical data

---

### 5.3 Portfolio Optimization

**What**: Allocate capital across investments to maximize return for given risk

**Excel version**:
- Calculate returns, covariance matrix
- Solver add-in for optimization (clunky, limited)

**Python version** (scipy.optimize):
- Define objective (maximize Sharpe ratio)
- Constraints (no single stock `>20`%, total weight = 100%)
- Optimize with `scipy.optimize.minimize()`

**When to graduate Excel → Python**:
- Portfolio `>10` assets (Excel Solver slow)
- Need advanced constraints (sector limits, ESG filters)
- Backtesting (test allocation over historical periods)

**Libraries**: scipy.optimize, pandas, vectorbt (if backtesting)

**Use case**: Hedge funds, pension funds, personal portfolio ($100K+ investable)

---

### 5.4 Derivatives Pricing

**What**: Calculate fair value of options, swaps, exotics

**Excel version**:
- Black-Scholes formula in Excel (works for simple European options)
- Limited to closed-form formulas

**Python version** (QuantLib):
- 100+ pricing models (American options, path-dependent, multi-asset)
- Yield curve construction, credit risk (CVA, XVA)
- Production-grade (used by Bloomberg, JP Morgan)

**When Excel breaks**:
- American options (no closed-form, need binomial tree or Monte Carlo)
- Path-dependent (Asian options, lookback options)
- Multi-asset (correlation matters)

**Libraries**: QuantLib (S1: 100-hour learning curve, quant finance specialist)

**3-Year TCO**: $81,720 (S2) - but **no SaaS alternative** (must DIY)

**Use case**: Hedge funds, investment banks, derivatives traders

---

### 5.5 Risk Analysis (Monte Carlo)

**What**: Quantify uncertainty in financial projections

**Excel version**:
- Data tables (limited to 2 variables)
- @RISK add-in ($500/year/user, commercial Monte Carlo tool)

**Python version** (scipy.stats, PyMC):
- scipy.stats: Simple Monte Carlo (10,000 scenarios in seconds)
- PyMC: Bayesian inference (complex correlations, credible intervals)

**When to graduate Excel → Python**:
- Need `>10`,000 scenarios (Excel slow)
- Complex correlations (revenue growth ↔ churn ↔ marketing ROI)
- Bayesian methods (incorporate prior knowledge, update beliefs)

**Libraries**: scipy.stats (simple), PyMC (advanced Bayesian)

**Use case**: Strategic decisions ($10M+ capital allocation, M&A, fundraising)

---

## 6. Common Questions

### Q1: "Do I need to know Python to use financial simulation?"

**Short answer**: For **programming-based simulation** (this research - 1.127), yes. For **SaaS** (3.004), no.

**Options**:
1. **Learn Python**: 40-100 hours to proficiency (pandas + numpy-financial)
2. **Hire someone**: Data scientist, quant analyst, consultant
3. **Use SaaS**: Pulse, Finmark, Causal (3.004 research) - no coding required
4. **Excel + add-ins**: @RISK (Monte Carlo), Solver (optimization)

**Recommendation**: If you're asking this question, **start with SaaS** (3.004). Learn Python only if:
- SaaS too expensive (`>$800/month`)
- Need custom models (derivatives, Bayesian)
- Have developer background (software engineer, data scientist)

---

### Q2: "Can Excel do financial simulation?"

**Short answer**: Yes, for **simple use cases**. Breaks down for **complex scenarios**.

**What Excel CAN do**:
- Basic NPV, IRR (=NPV(), =IRR())
- Simple forecasting (=FORECAST(), trendlines)
- Data tables (2-variable sensitivity analysis)
- Solver (optimization, `<100` variables)

**What Excel CANNOT do (or does poorly)**:
- Forecasting with seasonality (Prophet automatic, Excel manual)
- Monte Carlo `>1`,000 scenarios (slow, need @RISK add-in)
- Derivatives pricing (no QuantLib equivalent, limited to Black-Scholes formula)
- Version control (Git doesn't work with .xlsx, email hell)
- Automation (manual refresh, copy-paste errors)

**Excel → Python graduation path**:
1. Excel works (keep using it)
2. Excel breaking (file size, complexity, speed) → Graduate to Python or SaaS
3. Evaluate: Python ($11K-82K 3yr TCO) vs SaaS ($1K-54K)

---

### Q3: "What's the difference between Monte Carlo and forecasting?"

**Forecasting**: **Predict the most likely future value**
- Example: "Revenue next year will be $1.2M" (single point estimate)
- Methods: Prophet (time series), statsmodels (regression)

**Monte Carlo**: **Quantify uncertainty around future value**
- Example: "Revenue next year will be $800K-$1.5M (95% confidence interval)"
- Methods: scipy.stats (sample from distributions), PyMC (Bayesian)

**When to use what**:
- **Forecasting**: Budgeting, planning (need single number for target)
- **Monte Carlo**: Risk analysis, stress testing (need to know "how bad could it get?")

**Often combined**: Forecast revenue = $1.2M, then Monte Carlo to quantify uncertainty ($800K-1.5M range)

---

### Q4: "Is QuantLib overkill for my startup?"

**Short answer**: **Yes, unless you're a fintech company pricing derivatives**.

**When you DON'T need QuantLib**:
- Cash flow modeling (use numpy-financial: NPV, IRR - 2-hour learning curve)
- Revenue forecasting (use Prophet - 10-hour learning curve)
- Basic portfolio allocation (use scipy.optimize)

**When you NEED QuantLib**:
- Pricing options, swaps, swaptions, exotic derivatives
- Fixed income analytics (yield curves, bond pricing, duration matching)
- Credit risk (CVA, XVA calculations)
- **You work at**: Hedge fund, investment bank, derivatives desk

**QuantLib learning curve**: 100-200 hours (requires quant finance background - stochastic calculus, Black-Scholes, no-arbitrage pricing)

**Cost**: $81,720 3-year TCO (S2) - hire quant specialist or consultant

**Recommendation**: 99% of startups should **NOT use QuantLib**. Use numpy-financial or SaaS instead.

---

### Q5: "Should I use R or Python for financial modeling?"

**Short answer**: **Python (2025 and beyond)**. R declining in finance (S4 ecosystem trends).

**Python advantages**:
- Broader ecosystem (ML, web, automation - not just finance)
- pandas parity with R's tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2 equivalents exist)
- QuantLib better maintained in Python vs RQuantLib
- Corporate adoption (Google, Meta, Amazon standardize on Python)
- Hiring pool: 5M+ Python developers vs 100K+ R developers

**R advantages**:
- Mature finance packages (quantmod, PerformanceAnalytics - 20+ years)
- Academic preference (econometrics, statistics research still R-first)
- Subjectively: ggplot2 (visualization) slightly better than matplotlib

**Market trends** (S4 Strategic):
- Python: 70% market share (2025) → 85% (2035)
- R: 25% → 10% (academia survives, industry declines)

**Recommendation**: **If starting new project, use Python**. If existing R codebase, stay in R (migration not worth it unless need ML integration).

---

### Q6: "What's Bayesian inference and do I need it?"

**What**: Method to **quantify uncertainty and update beliefs** using Bayes' theorem.

**Example**: Estimating revenue growth rate
- **Frequentist** (normal statistics): "Growth rate = 14.2% (p-value = 0.03)"
- **Bayesian**: "Growth rate = 14% ± 3% (80% credible interval: 11-17%)"

**Bayesian advantages**:
- **Interpretable probabilities**: "80% chance growth `>10`%" (vs p-value confusion)
- **Incorporates prior knowledge**: Industry benchmarks, expert opinion
- **Quantifies uncertainty**: Credible intervals (not just point estimates)

**Bayesian cost**:
- **Computational**: MCMC sampling takes 10 seconds to hours (vs `<1` second normal stats)
- **Learning**: Requires Bayesian statistics knowledge (40-hour curve for PyMC)

**When you need Bayesian**:
- High-stakes decisions ($10M+ M&A, capital allocation) - worth rigor
- Uncertainty quantification critical (insurance, risk management)
- Regulatory requirements (model validation, stress testing)

**When you DON'T need Bayesian**:
- Simple forecasting (Prophet works, no Bayesian required)
- Quick analysis (scipy.stats Monte Carlo faster)
- Business audience (Bayesian credible intervals confuse non-technical stakeholders)

**Libraries**: PyMC (S1: 40-hour learning curve, NumFOCUS-backed)

**Recommendation**: **Most companies don't need Bayesian**. Use simple Monte Carlo (scipy.stats) unless you're in insurance, quant finance, or research.

---

### Q7: "How do I choose between pandas, numpy-financial, Prophet, and QuantLib?"

**Decision tree**:

```
What do you need to do?
│
├─ Cash flow modeling (NPV, IRR, loan amortization)
│   → pandas (data) + numpy-financial (formulas)
│   Learning: 2-5 hours, TCO: $11,430 (3yr)
│
├─ Revenue forecasting (predict future with seasonality)
│   → pandas (data) + Prophet (forecasting)
│   Learning: 10 hours, TCO: $22,860 (3yr)
│
├─ Econometric regression (causal relationships)
│   → pandas (data) + statsmodels (regression)
│   Learning: 10 hours, TCO: $22,860 (3yr)
│
├─ Derivatives pricing (options, swaps, fixed income)
│   → pandas (data) + QuantLib (pricing)
│   Learning: 100-200 hours, TCO: $81,720 (3yr)
│
├─ Trading strategy backtesting
│   → pandas (data) + vectorbt (backtesting)
│   Learning: 20 hours, TCO: $12,000 (3yr)
│
└─ Bayesian uncertainty quantification
    → pandas (data) + PyMC (Bayesian inference)
    Learning: 40-100 hours, TCO: $31,800 (3yr)
```

**Universal rule**: **pandas is always in the stack** (99.9% 10-year survival, S4 Strategic). Choose domain-specific library based on use case.

---

### Q8: "What's the risk of using open source libraries vs SaaS?"

**Open source libraries (1.127)**:

**Risks**:
- **Maintenance burden**: You must upgrade, fix breaking changes (10-40 hours every 3 years)
- **No support**: No phone number to call (rely on Stack Overflow, GitHub issues)
- **Library abandonment**: vectorbt (60% 10-year survival, single maintainer risk - S4)

**Benefits**:
- **Zero lock-in**: Code is yours, data is yours ($0 escape cost vs SaaS $3K-9K)
- **Customization**: Unlimited flexibility (SaaS has feature limits)
- **Cost**: $11K-82K (3yr) vs SaaS $1K-54K (depends on SaaS tier)

**SaaS (3.004)**:

**Risks**:
- **Lock-in**: $750-9K escape cost to migrate (3.004 research)
- **Vendor stability**: 60-95% 5-year confidence (Mosaic, Dryrun lower, Pulse higher)
- **Price increases**: 5-10%/year (compounds over 10 years)

**Benefits**:
- **No maintenance**: Vendor handles upgrades, bug fixes
- **Support**: Chat, phone, onboarding help
- **Collaboration**: UI for non-technical users (CFO, CEO, board)

**Recommendation**: **Hedge your bets**:
- Start with **SaaS** (cheap, easy, fast time-to-value)
- Keep **exit plan** (know how to export data, have DIY alternative identified)
- Graduate to **libraries** when SaaS `>$800/mo` or custom models needed

---

### Q9: "Can I use libraries AND SaaS together?"

**Short answer**: **Yes, and it's often optimal** (hybrid approach).

**Hybrid patterns**:

1. **SaaS for collaboration, libraries for custom models**
   - Use Causal (SaaS) for board reporting (UI, scenarios)
   - Use QuantLib (libraries) for derivatives pricing (custom, proprietary)
   - Example: Hedge fund (Scenario 4, S3)

2. **SaaS for simple, libraries for complex**
   - Use Pulse (SaaS) for daily cash flow monitoring
   - Use pandas + Prophet for 12-month revenue forecast (custom seasonality)
   - Example: SaaS startup Series B

3. **SaaS for production, libraries for research**
   - Use Arius (SaaS) for regulatory reporting (insurance)
   - Use pandas + PyMC for custom actuarial models (research)
   - Example: Insurance actuary (Scenario 10, S3)

**Benefits**:
- **Best of both worlds**: UI + customization
- **Risk mitigation**: Not locked into SaaS or libraries exclusively
- **Cost optimization**: Use cheap SaaS for 80% of needs, libraries for 20% high-value custom

**Cost**: SaaS ($7K-29K 3yr) + libraries ($11K-23K) = **$18K-52K 3yr total**

**Recommendation**: **Hybrid is often the right answer** for mid-market companies (50-500 employees).
