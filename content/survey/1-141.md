<summary>S1: Rapid Discovery</summary>

# Anki SM-2 (Anki's SM-2 Variant)

**PyPI Package**: `anki-sm-2`
**GitHub**: open-spaced-repetition/anki-sm-2
**Algorithm**: Anki's SM-2 variant (pre-2023)

## Popularity Metrics

- **Downloads**: 156/month (PyPI)
- **GitHub Stars**: (part of open-spaced-repetition org)
- **Maintenance**: Active (released October 2024)
- **Latest Release**: v0.2.0 (October 31, 2024)
- **Python Requirement**: `>=3.10`
- **License**: GNU AGPL v3

## Quick Assessment

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Anki-compatible** (matches Anki's original algorithm)
- ✅ **Recent release** (October 2024)
- ✅ **Open Spaced Repetition org** (same maintainers as FSRS)
- ✅ **Clean implementation** (Scheduler + Card + ReviewLog objects)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ **Lowest popularity** (47× fewer downloads than FSRS)
- ⚠️ **Legacy algorithm** (Anki moved to FSRS as default in v23.10)
- ⚠️ **AGPL license** (more restrictive than MIT)
- ⚠️ **Unclear positioning** (why not use FSRS from same org?)

## Installation

```bash
pip install anki-sm-2
```

## Basic Usage Pattern

```python
from anki_sm_2 import Scheduler, Card, Rating

# Initialize scheduler
scheduler = Scheduler()

# Create card
card = Card()

# Review card
scheduling_cards = scheduler.review_card(card, Rating.Good)
card = scheduling_cards[Rating.Good].card
```

## Confidence for Personal Language Learning

**LOW** - Same organization now recommends FSRS (their newer, better algorithm).

## Notes

Maintained by same organization that created FSRS. The fact they built FSRS suggests SM-2 is being phased out. Anki itself moved to FSRS as default in 2023.

# S2-Comprehensive: Technical Architecture Analysis

**Research Date**: 2026-01-16
**Duration**: Extended technical deep-dive
**Focus**: Mathematical formulas, memory models, implementation details

---

## SM-2 Algorithm Technical Architecture

### Mathematical Foundation

**Core Formula: Easiness Factor (EF)**

```
EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5-q) * (0.08 + (5-q) * 0.02))
```

Where:
- `EF'` = New easiness factor
- `EF` = Old easiness factor
- `q` = Quality of response (0-5 grade scale)

**Initial Values**:
- All items start with `EF = 2.5`
- Minimum allowed: `EF = 1.3` (if calculated EF < 1.3, set to 1.3)

**Sources**:
- [SuperMemo 2: Algorithm](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)
- [SM-2 Algorithm Explained](https://tegaru.app/en/blog/sm2-algorithm-explained)

### Interval Calculation

```
I(1) = 1 day
I(2) = 6 days
For n > 2: I(n) = I(n-1) * EF
```

Where:
- `I(n)` = Inter-repetition interval after the n-th repetition (in days)
- `EF` = E-Factor of the item

**Sources**:
- [SuperMemo 2: Algorithm](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)

### Quality Rating Scale (0-5)

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **5** | Perfect response |
| **4** | Correct response after hesitation |
| **3** | Correct response with serious difficulty |
| **2** | Incorrect; correct one seemed easy to recall |
| **1** | Incorrect; correct one remembered |
| **0** | Complete blackout |

**Logic**:
- If `q >= 3` (correct): Proceed with normal interval progression
- If `q < 3` (incorrect): Reset `n = 0`, `I = 1`, EF unchanged

**Sources**:
- [SM-2 Algorithm Explained](https://tegaru.app/en/blog/sm2-algorithm-explained)
- [SATHEE: SM-2 Algorithm](https://sathee.iitk.ac.in/pyqs/spaced-repetition/algorithms/sm2-algorithm/)

### Three Core Variables

1. **Repetition Number (n)**: Count of successful reviews
2. **Easiness Factor (EF)**: Difficulty rating (1.1 to 2.5)
3. **Interval (I)**: Days until next review

### Limitations

1. **Hardcoded Initial Intervals**: 1-day and 6-day first intervals don't account for individual differences
2. **Static Difficulty**: Assumes item difficulty is constant over time
3. **Coarse Granularity**: 6-point scale (0-5) lacks nuance
4. **No Forgetting Curve**: Doesn't model retrievability probability

## SM-18 Algorithm Technical Architecture

### Two-Component Model of Memory

**Fundamental Variables**:

1. **Stability (S)**: Duration of memory if undisturbed (measured in days)
2. **Retrievability (R)**: Probability of successful recall at any given time

**Theory**: Two variables are sufficient to describe the status of unitary memory

**Sources**:
- [Two components of memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_memory)
- [Algorithm SM-17](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17)

### Key Improvements Over SM-17

1. **Dynamic Item Difficulty**: Departure from assumption that difficulty is constant
   - Evidence: Dramatic changes in item difficulty during learning
   - Explanation: **Anchoring** - new mnemonic context converts difficult → easy overnight

2. **Improved Stabilization Function**: Better approximation of memory stability increase

3. **Parameter Optimizations**: Several minor tuning improvements

**Sources**:
- [Algorithm SM-18](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18)
- [SuperMemo Algorithm](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Algorithm)

### Stabilization Function

**Inputs**:
- Stability at review (S, in days)
- Retrievability at review (R)
- Memory complexity (item difficulty)

**Outputs**:
- New stability (S')

**Implementation**: Uses memory matrices:
- **Stabilization matrix (SInc[])**: Stores stability increase factors
- **Recall matrix (Recall[])**: Stores recall probabilities

**Sources**:
- [Algorithm SM-18](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18)
- [Stabilization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stabilization)

### Release and Status

- **Release Date**: 2019 (May)
- **Used in**: SuperMemo 18
- **Predecessor**: SM-17 (2016) - first two-component model implementation
- **Availability**: Proprietary (licensing required)

## FSRS Algorithm Technical Architecture

### DSR Model (Difficulty, Stability, Retrievability)

**Origin**: DHP model from MaiMemo (variant of DSR model)

**Three Core Variables**:

1. **Retrievability (R)**: Probability of successful recall at given moment
   - Depends on: Time elapsed since last review, memory stability (S)

2. **Stability (S)**: Time (days) for R to decrease from 100% to 90%
   - Example: `S = 365` → entire year before recall probability drops to 90%

3. **Difficulty (D)**: Inherent complexity of information
   - Affects: How fast stability grows after each review

**Sources**:
- [The Algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm)
- [A technical explanation of FSRS](https://expertium.github.io/Algorithm.html)

### Mathematical Formulas

**Retrievability Formula (Forgetting Curve)**:

```
R(t, S) = (1.0 + F * (t / S))^C
```

Where:
- `F = 19.0 / 81.0` (decay factor)
- `C = -0.5` (decay power)
- `t` = Time elapsed since review
- `S` = Stability

## Integration Complexity

### SM-2 Integration

**Complexity**: Low
- Simple state (3 variables per card)
- No training required
- Stateless (no cross-card dependencies)

**Typical Integration Steps**:
1. Install library: `pip install supermemo2`
2. Initialize card state (n=0, EF=2.5, I=0)
3. After each review: Pass quality (0-5), get next interval
4. Store updated state

**Code Example** (pseudocode):
```python
from supermemo2 import SMTwo

card = SMTwo(quality=0, interval=0, repetitions=0, efactor=2.5)
quality = 4  # User rated "correct after hesitation"
card.review(quality)
next_interval = card.interval  # Days until next review
```

**Sources**:
- [supermemo2 · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/supermemo2/)
- [GitHub - thyagoluciano/sm2](https://github.com/thyagoluciano/sm2)

### FSRS Integration

**Complexity**: Moderate
- Complex state (D, S, R per card)
- Requires parameter optimization (initial training)
- Benefits from large review history dataset

**Typical Integration Steps**:
1. Install library: `pip install fsrs`
2. Collect user review history (if available)
3. Optimize 21 parameters using ML (or use defaults)
4. Initialize card state (D, S)
5. After each review: Calculate R, update D/S, get next interval
6. Periodically re-optimize parameters

**Anki Integration** (built-in as of 23.10):
- Toggle FSRS in Deck Options → Advanced section
- Anki auto-optimizes parameters from review history
- Migration: 1-5 minutes depending on deck size

|---------|------|------|-------|
| **Lines of code** | ~50 | ~100-200 | Unknown |
| **Dependencies** | None | ML libs | Proprietary |
| **Setup time** | Minutes | 1-5 min (migration) | N/A |
| **Ongoing training** | Never | Optional (monthly) | Unknown |

**Performance Requirements**:

| Metric | SM-2 | FSRS | SM-18 |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Success rate** | 47-60% | 89.6% | Unknown (likely `&gt;90`%) |
| **Review reduction** | Baseline | 20-30% fewer | Best-in-class |
| **Retention target** | Fixed | Configurable | Adaptive |

### Step 3: Evaluate Team Constraints

**Team Size**:
- **Solo/Small (1-3)**: SM-2 (fast, simple)
- **Medium (3-10)**: FSRS (balance of performance and complexity)
- **Large (10+)**: FSRS or SM-18 (resources for optimization)

**Team Expertise**:
- **Beginners**: SM-2 (minimal learning curve)
- **Intermediate**: FSRS (moderate ML familiarity helpful)
- **Advanced**: FSRS or SM-18 (full optimization capability)

**Open-Source Requirement**:
- **Yes**: SM-2 or FSRS only
- **No**: SM-2, FSRS, or SM-18

### Step 4: Budget Considerations

**Development Budget**:
- **`<$50K`**: SM-2 (MVP, simple implementation)
- **$50K-$150K**: FSRS (production-ready)
- **`>$150K`**: FSRS with advanced features, or explore SM-18 licensing

**Operating Budget** (per 10K active users):
- **SM-2**: $200-$500/month (minimal compute)
- **FSRS**: $300-$800/month (parameter optimization compute)
- **SM-18**: Unknown (licensing fees)

## Algorithm Vendor Lock-in Analysis

### Lock-in Risk Dimensions

**5 Lock-in Categories**:

1. **Algorithm Lock-in**: Switching cost if algorithm is proprietary
2. **Data Lock-in**: Export/import difficulty for review history
3. **Platform Lock-in**: Mobile vs web vs desktop compatibility
4. **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Integrations, add-ons, community
5. **Knowledge Lock-in**: Team expertise in specific algorithm

### Algorithm Lock-in Scores (0-10, 10 = highest lock-in)

| Algorithm | Algorithm | Data | Platform | Ecosystem | Knowledge | **Total** | Risk Level |
|-----------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **SM-2** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | **5** | Very Low |
| **FSRS** | 1 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 5 | **13** | Low |
| **SM-18** | 10 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 6 | **40** | Very High |

**Analysis**:
- **SM-2**: Minimal lock-in (public domain, simple state, widely implemented)
- **FSRS**: Low lock-in (open-source, but 21 parameters create data migration complexity)
- **SM-18**: Very high lock-in (proprietary, SuperMemo exclusive, no public implementation)

### Portability Solutions

**Data Export Standards**:
- **Anki**: .apkg format (open, well-documented)
- **SuperMemo**: .kno format (proprietary)
- **Universal**: CSV export (lowest common denominator)

**Algorithm Abstraction**:
- Design abstraction layer: separate algorithm logic from app logic
- Enables swapping SM-2 ↔ FSRS without full rewrite

**State Migration**:
- SM-2 → FSRS: Moderate complexity (map EF to D/S)
- FSRS → SM-2: High complexity (loss of D/S granularity)
- SM-18 → anything: Impossible (proprietary state)

---

## Migration Paths & Complexity

### SM-2 → FSRS Migration

**Complexity**: Moderate

**Steps**:
1. Export review history (CSV or database dump)
2. Map SM-2 state to FSRS state:
   - Easiness Factor (EF) → Difficulty (D) approximation
   - Interval (I) → Stability (S) approximation
3. Optimize FSRS parameters using review history
4. Test with subset of users (A/B test)
5. Gradual rollout

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Cost**: $10K-$30K (development + testing)

**Data Mapping**:
```
D (Difficulty) ≈ f(EF)  // Lower EF → Higher D
S (Stability) ≈ I       // Interval approximates stability
R (Retrievability) = 0.9  // Initial assumption
```

**Anki Example**:
- Built-in migration: 1-5 minutes per user
- Preserves review history
- Can revert to SM-2 if needed

**Sources**:
- [How to use FSRS on Anki](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/how-to-use-the-next-generation-spaced-repetition-algorithm-fsrs-on-anki/25415)
- [FSRS vs SM-2 Guide](https://memoforge.app/blog/fsrs-vs-sm2-anki-algorithm-guide-2025/)

### FSRS → SM-2 Migration

**Complexity**: High (data loss)

**Challenge**: FSRS has 3 variables (D, S, R) → SM-2 has 2 (EF, I)

**Data Loss**:
- Retrievability (R) discarded
- Difficulty (D) → Easiness Factor (EF) mapping lossy
- 21 parameters lost

**When Necessary**:
- Downgrading to simpler system (cost reduction)
- Moving to platform that only supports SM-2
- Regulatory/compliance requirements (explainability)

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Cost**: $5K-$15K

### SM-18 → FSRS Migration

**Complexity**: Very High (proprietary state)

**Challenge**: SuperMemo state is proprietary, no public mapping

**Approach**:
1. Export review history from SuperMemo (if allowed by license)
2. Treat as new FSRS dataset
3. Optimize FSRS parameters from scratch
4. No direct state transfer possible

**Duration**: 4-8 weeks (mostly re-training)
**Cost**: $20K-$50K (includes parameter optimization)

### Migration Strategy Matrix

| From | To | Complexity | Data Loss | Duration | Cost |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|----------|------|
| **SM-2 → FSRS** | Moderate | Minimal | 2-4 weeks | $10K-$30K |
| **FSRS → SM-2** | High | Significant | 1-2 weeks | $5K-$15K |
| **SM-18 → FSRS** | Very High | Complete | 4-8 weeks | $20K-$50K |
| **SM-18 → SM-2** | Very High | Complete | 4-8 weeks | $20K-$50K |

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Startups (`&lt;10` employees, `<$500K` revenue)

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: **SM-2**
- Fast implementation (3-4 weeks)
- Zero licensing cost
- Validate product-market fit

**Phase 2 (Post-PMF)**: **Migrate to FSRS**
- After achieving product-market fit
- User retention becomes critical
- 20-30% review reduction = competitive advantage

**Why not SM-18?**: Licensing cost unjustified for startups

### For Mid-Market (10-100 employees, $500K-$10M revenue)

**Default Choice**: **FSRS**
- Production-ready from day 1
- Proven performance gains
- Open-source eliminates licensing risk

**Alternative**: **SM-2 → FSRS migration**
- If already using SM-2, plan migration within 6-12 months
- Budget $10K-$30K for migration

### For Enterprise (100+ employees, $10M+ revenue)

**Default Choice**: **FSRS**
- Open-source preferred (no vendor lock-in)
- Community support + internal expertise

**Alternative**: **SM-18 (via SuperMemo licensing)**
- If best-in-class performance required
- Budget allows proprietary licensing
- Compliance/audit requirements met by SuperMemo

**Avoid**: SM-2 (insufficient for enterprise scale)

### For Agencies/Consultancies

**Default**: **FSRS**
- Flexibility across clients
- No licensing fees to pass through
- Modern, ML-driven (appeals to clients)

**Avoid**: SM-18 (client lock-in concerns)

---

## Exit Strategy Planning

### What If Your Algorithm Becomes Obsolete?

**Scenario 1: FSRS Superseded by FSRS v2/v3**

**Likelihood**: Moderate (iterative improvements expected)

**Mitigation**:
1. Open-source nature ensures smooth upgrades
2. Parameters can be re-optimized
3. No vendor lock-in (can fork if needed)

**Scenario 2: SuperMemo Discontinues SM-18**

**Likelihood**: Low (but possible)

**Mitigation**:
1. License agreement should include source code escrow
2. Plan migration to FSRS (4-8 weeks, $20K-$50K)
3. Maintain abstraction layer in codebase

**Scenario 3: Regulatory Requirements Force Algorithm Change**

**Likelihood**: Very Low (but considered in healthcare/education)

**Mitigation**:
1. Explainability: SM-2 > FSRS > SM-18
2. If required, fallback to SM-2 (simple, auditable)
3. Budget 1-2 weeks for migration

### General Exit Strategy

**Every 12 months**:
1. **Audit Algorithm Performance**: Benchmark against latest research
2. **Evaluate Alternatives**: Monitor new algorithms (LECTOR, SSP-MMC, etc.)
3. **Maintain Abstraction**: Keep algorithm swappable
4. **Document State**: Clear mapping of algorithm state to universal format (CSV)

**Red Flags** (trigger exit planning):
- Community activity drops `&gt;50`% YoY (FSRS risk)
- Licensing fees increase `&gt;20`% YoY (SM-18 risk)
- Major security vulnerability discovered
- Regulatory compliance issues

**Reasoning**:
1. Anki's multi-million user base drives FSRS adoption
2. Open-source enables rapid iteration (FSRS-6 → FSRS-7+)
3. ML-driven optimization aligns with AI/ML trends
4. SuperMemo's proprietary model limits SM-18 adoption

**Wild Card**: LLM-enhanced SRS (LECTOR-style) may disrupt entirely
- LECTOR (2025): 90.2% success rate (vs FSRS 89.6%)
- Combines LLM reasoning with traditional SRS
- Requires significant compute (cost barrier for now)

## Summary: Lock-in Risk Mitigation

### Lowest Risk Algorithms

1. **SM-2**: Zero lock-in (public domain, simple state, widely implemented)
2. **FSRS**: Low lock-in (open-source, active community, Anki integration)

### Highest Risk Algorithm

1. **SM-18**: Very high lock-in (proprietary, SuperMemo exclusive, licensing required)

### Best Practices

**For Startups**: Use SM-2 (MVP), migrate to FSRS post-PMF
**For Mid-Market**: Use FSRS (balance of performance and flexibility)
**For Enterprise**: Use FSRS (open-source preferred) or SM-18 (if licensing budget allows)

**Universal Rule**: Maintain abstraction layer and data portability to enable migration if needed

**Research Duration**: 2.5 hours
**Primary Sources**: Market reports, algorithm documentation, migration case studies
**Confidence Level**: High for migration paths, Medium for 10-year predictions (inherently uncertain)
