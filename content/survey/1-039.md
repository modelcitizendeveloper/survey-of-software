## Architecture Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Recommended Patterns:

#### **Server-Side Template Architecture**:
```python
# Jinja2 production pattern
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader, select_autoescape
import redis

class TemplateEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.env = Environment(
            loader=FileSystemLoader('templates/'),
            autoescape=select_autoescape(['html', 'xml']),
            cache_size=1000
        )
        self.redis = redis.Redis()

    def render_with_cache(self, template_name, context, cache_key=None):
        if cache_key:
            cached = self.redis.get(cache_key)
            if cached:
                return cached.decode()

        template = self.env.get_template(template_name)
        rendered = template.render(**context)

        if cache_key:
            self.redis.setex(cache_key, 3600, rendered)

        return rendered

    def render_email(self, template_name, user_data):
        context = {
            'user': user_data,
            'company': get_company_branding(),
            'unsubscribe_url': generate_unsubscribe_url(user_data['id'])
        }
        return self.render_with_cache(
            template_name,
            context,
            f"email:{template_name}:{user_data['id']}"
        )
```

#### **Component-Based Architecture (React)**:
```jsx
// React component pattern
import React, { memo } from 'react';

// Memoized template component
const UserDashboard = memo(({ user, metrics, onUpdate }) => {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Header user={user} />
      <MetricsList
        metrics={metrics}
        onUpdate={onUpdate}
      />
      <ActionPanel user={user} />
    </div>
  );
});

// Template composition
const MetricsList = ({ metrics, onUpdate }) => (
  <div className="metrics">
    {metrics.map(metric => (
      <MetricCard
        key={metric.id}
        metric={metric}
        onUpdate={onUpdate}
      />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

#### **Template Logic Overload**:
```python
# BAD: Complex logic in templates
"""
{% for user in users %}
  {% if user.subscription.plan == 'premium' and user.usage > threshold %}
    {% set discount = calculate_discount(user.usage, user.subscription.start_date) %}
    <div class="premium-user">{{ user.name }} - {{ discount }}% off</div>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
"""

# GOOD: Logic in view functions
def get_premium_users_with_discounts(users):
    premium_users = []
    for user in users:
        if user.subscription.plan == 'premium' and user.usage > threshold:
            discount = calculate_discount(user.usage, user.subscription.start_date)
            premium_users.append({
                'user': user,
                'discount': discount
            })
    return premium_users

# Template becomes simple
"""
{% for item in premium_users %}
  <div class="premium-user">{{ item.user.name }} - {{ item.discount }}% off</div>
{% endfor %}
"""
```

#### **Template Security Vulnerabilities**:
```python
# BAD: Manual string concatenation
def unsafe_template(user_input):
    return f"<div>Hello {user_input}</div>"  # XSS vulnerability

# GOOD: Use template engine escaping
template = env.get_template('greeting.html')
return template.render(user_input=user_input)  # Auto-escaped
```

## Conclusion

**Requirements-driven analysis reveals template engine selection must match specific technical and business constraints**:

1. **Multi-tenant/Security-critical applications** → Jinja2 or Twig
2. **Email marketing and simple content** → Handlebars or Mustache
3. **Interactive real-time applications** → React JSX or Vue Templates
4. **Document and report generation** → Jinja2
5. **Configuration management** → Jinja2
6. **Content management systems** → Twig (PHP) or Jinja2 (Python)

**Key insight**: No single template engine optimally serves all requirements - success comes from **matching engines to specific constraints** including performance, security, team skills, and integration needs.

**Optimal strategy**: Choose primary engine based on dominant constraints, build **hybrid systems** combining multiple engines for different use cases (e.g., Jinja2 for server-side + React for interactive components), and maintain **security-first approach** with proper escaping and sandboxing regardless of engine choice.
