nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp.add_pipe("sentencizer")
nlp.add_pipe("entity_ruler")
nlp.add_pipe("textcat")

def process_documents(documents):
    return [nlp(doc) for doc in nlp.pipe(documents, batch_size=100)]
```

#### **Hybrid Approach (spaCy + Transformers)**:
```python
# Use spaCy for preprocessing, Transformers for advanced tasks
import spacy
from transformers import pipeline

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

def analyze_text(text):
    doc = nlp(text)  # Fast preprocessing

    # Extract entities with spaCy (fast)
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]

    # Sentiment with Transformers (accurate)
    sentiment = classifier(text)[0]

    return {
        'entities': entities,
        'sentiment': sentiment,
        'tokens': [token.lemma_ for token in doc]
    }
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

#### **Loading Models Repeatedly**:
```python
# BAD: Loading model for each request
def process_text(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")  # Slow!
    return nlp(text)

# GOOD: Load once and reuse
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
def process_text(text):
    return nlp(text)
```

#### **Using Wrong Tool for Task**:
```python
# BAD: Using NLTK for production entity recognition
# BAD: Using Transformers for simple tokenization
# BAD: Using TextBlob for complex language understanding

# GOOD: Match tool to requirements
# Production NER → spaCy
# Research/Education → NLTK
