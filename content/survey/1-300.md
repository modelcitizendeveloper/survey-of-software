# Domain Explainer: Public Finance Modeling

## What is Public Finance Modeling?

Public finance modeling refers to the computational simulation of tax and benefit policies to understand their impacts on individuals, households, and populations. Unlike general-purpose financial modeling (which might analyze corporate cash flows or investment portfolios), public finance modeling specifically deals with government revenue systems and social programs.

## Why It Matters

**Policy decisions affect millions of lives.** When legislators propose changing tax rates, creating new credits, or modifying benefit eligibility, they need to understand:

- **Who wins and who loses?** Distributional analysis shows which income groups benefit or pay more
- **How much will it cost?** Revenue estimates project fiscal impacts
- **What are the incentive effects?** Marginal tax rate calculations reveal work incentives
- **Will it reduce poverty?** Benefit simulations estimate poverty reduction

Without computational models, policy analysis relies on back-of-the-envelope estimates or small samples that may not represent the full population.

## How It Works: Microsimulation

The core technique is **microsimulation**:

1. **Start with representative microdata** (census, IRS data, surveys)
   - Each record represents a household or individual
   - Contains income, family structure, state of residence, etc.

2. **Encode tax/benefit rules as code**
   - Federal income tax: brackets, deductions, credits
   - State income tax: rates, conformity with federal rules
   - Benefits: eligibility criteria, phase-outs

3. **Apply rules to every record**
   - Calculate tax liability or benefit eligibility
   - Weight by population to get national/state estimates

4. **Compare baseline vs. reform**
   - Baseline: Current law
   - Reform: Proposed policy change
   - Difference: Who gains/loses, revenue impact

**Example:**
- Baseline: Child Tax Credit is $2,000 per child
- Reform: Increase to $4,000 per child
- Model: Apply both rules to 200,000 household records
- Output: "Reform reduces poverty by 1.2M people, costs $100B/year"

## Who Uses These Tools?

### Government Agencies
- **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**: Scores legislation for fiscal impact
- **Treasury Department**: Revenue estimates for tax proposals
- **UK HM Treasury**: Uses PolicyEngine for official modeling
- **French Government**: Uses OpenFisca for tax-benefit analysis

### Think Tanks & Policy Organizations
- **Tax Policy Center**: Analyzes tax reform proposals
- **Center on Budget and Policy Priorities**: Evaluates anti-poverty programs
- **American Enterprise Institute**: Conservative policy analysis
- (Tools are used across political spectrum)

### Academic Researchers
- Study tax incidence (who really pays taxes)
- Analyze behavioral responses (do tax changes affect work decisions?)
- Evaluate program effectiveness (does EITC reduce poverty?)
- Publish in journals like *National Tax Journal*, *Journal of Public Economics*

### Advocacy Groups
- Labor unions: Analyze wage tax interactions
- Business groups: Corporate tax burden analysis
- Anti-poverty advocates: Benefit program expansions
- State-level organizations: State budget analysis

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Data Quality
- **Microdata is expensive/restricted**: IRS Public Use File costs money, has privacy limitations
- **Survey underreporting**: High-income households underrepresented
- **Imputation needed**: Link multiple datasets to get full picture

### 2. Rule Complexity
- **Federal tax code**: 6,000+ pages of rules
- **Interactions**: EITC + Child Tax Credit + SNAP + Medicaid + housing assistance all interact
- **State variations**: 50 different state tax codes
- **Temporal changes**: Rules change every year, sometimes multiple times per year

### 3. Validation Difficulty
- **Aggregate statistics**: Can compare model output to published IRS totals
- **Individual accuracy**: Hard to validate individual-level calculations
- **Behavioral responses**: Models are often "static" (assume no behavior change)

## Why Open Source Matters

**Transparency in policymaking:**
- Tax laws affect everyone - models should be publicly auditable
- Proprietary models (like ITEP) are black boxes - can't verify methodology
- Open-source models can be peer-reviewed by academics

**Reproducibility:**
- Academic papers should provide replication code
- Policy organizations should show their work
- Open models enable independent validation

**Ecosystem effects:**
- Open tools lower barriers to entry for new researchers
- Collaboration improves quality (many eyes on the code)
- Government adoption is easier (no licensing fees, vendor lock-in)

## Current State of Open Source

**Strong foundation:**
- **Tax-Calculator**: US federal, public domain, widely used
- **PolicyEngine**: US + UK, all 50 states, web interface
- **OpenFisca**: Multi-country, government-adopted (France)

**Gaps:**
- **Property tax**: No open-source solution
- **Sales tax**: Commercial APIs exist (TaxJar, Avalara) but not research tools
- **Local income taxes**: NYC, Philadelphia underserved
- **Benefits**: SNAP, Medicaid less mature than tax modeling

## Comparison to Corporate Finance

| Aspect | Public Finance | Corporate Finance |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Taxes, benefits, equity | Investment, valuation, risk |
| **Users** | Government, think tanks | Companies, investors |
| **Data** | Microdata (census, IRS) | Financial statements |
| **Rules** | Tax code, eligibility criteria | Accounting standards |
| **Goals** | Equity, revenue, poverty | Profit, shareholder value |
| **Tools** | Tax-Calculator, OpenFisca | Excel, Bloomberg Terminal |

**Why separate?** Tax rules are qualitatively different from financial modeling:
- Discontinuities (phase-outs, cliffs) not smooth curves
- Legal complexity (6,000-page tax code vs. GAAP)
- Distributional focus (who pays) vs. aggregate focus (total profit)
- Public interest (open source, transparency) vs. competitive advantage (proprietary)

## Example: Child Tax Credit Reform

**Context:** Current Child Tax Credit (CTC) is $2,000 per child under 17. Proposal: increase to $4,000.

**Questions policymakers ask:**
1. How much does it cost?
2. Who benefits?
3. Does it reduce poverty?
4. What are the work incentive effects?

**How a model answers:**

**Output:**
- Cost: $120B per year
- Poverty reduction: 1.4M people (especially children)
- Gains: $2,000/year for families with children, $0 for childless households
- Work incentives: Minimal impact (CTC doesn't phase in with earnings)

**Policy debate:**
- Proponents: Reduces child poverty significantly
- Critics: Expensive, could prioritize other anti-poverty programs
- Model doesn't resolve debate, but quantifies trade-offs

## Key Terms

- **Microsimulation**: Applying rules to individual records and aggregating
- **Marginal Tax Rate (MTR)**: Extra tax paid on next dollar earned
- **Effective Tax Rate (ETR)**: Total tax / total income
- **Distributional Analysis**: Who pays / who benefits by income group
- **Revenue Estimate**: Projected government revenue under a policy
- **Baseline vs. Reform**: Current law vs. proposed change
- **Static Model**: Assumes no behavioral response to policy changes
- **Dynamic Model**: Estimates behavioral responses (labor supply, saving)
- **Incidence**: Who ultimately bears the economic burden of a tax

<summary>S1: Rapid Discovery</summary>

# S1: Problem Overview

## The Core Problem

**How do we know what a tax or benefit policy will do before we enact it?**

Policymakers face a dilemma:
- Pass legislation → wait months/years → see actual effects
- OR: Model the policy beforehand → identify problems → adjust

**Traditional approach (pre-2000s):**
- Government agencies build proprietary models
- Black-box calculations, no public access
- Researchers can't verify claims
- Each state/country duplicates effort

**Problem:** No transparency, no reproducibility, wasteful duplication

## Why This Is Hard

### 1. Complexity of Tax Codes

US federal income tax alone:
- ~100+ forms and schedules
- Hundreds of interacting provisions
- Phase-ins, phase-outs, cliffs, kinks
- Different definitions of income (AGI, MAGI, earned income)
- Credits vs. deductions vs. exemptions
- Alternative Minimum Tax (parallel tax system)

**Example interaction complexity:**
```
EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) depends on:
  → Earned income (wages, self-employment)
  → AGI (for phase-out)
  → Number of qualifying children
  → Filing status
  → Investment income limit ($11,000 threshold)

Change CTC (Child Tax Credit) →
  → Changes AGI →
  → Changes EITC phase-out →
  → Changes net refund
```

### 2. Multi-Level Government

In the US:
- Federal income tax
- State income tax (43 states)
- Local income tax (cities: NYC, Philadelphia)
- Property tax (3,000+ counties)
- Sales tax (11,000+ jurisdictions)

**Interactions:**
- State taxes deductible on federal return (SALT cap)
- Some states conform to federal rules, others don't
- Credits for taxes paid to other states
- Reciprocity agreements (commuter states)

### 3. Data Requirements

To model policies accurately, need:
- **Microdata:** Representative sample of population (Census, IRS)
- **Tax units:** Convert individuals to filing units (married/single)
- **Income components:** Wages, capital gains, dividends, etc.
- **Demographics:** Age, kids, disability status
- **Weights:** Scale sample to full population

**Problem:** Privacy laws limit access to detailed data

### 4. Behavioral Responses

Tax changes affect behavior:
- Higher marginal rates → work less (labor supply response)
- Tax credits for kids → more childbearing? (demographic response)
- Corporate rate changes → investment decisions (capital response)

**Static vs. dynamic modeling:**
- Static: Assume behavior doesn't change (simpler)
- Dynamic: Model behavioral responses (complex, uncertain)

Most libraries are static (documented limitation)

## What Public Finance Modeling Solves

### 1. Revenue Estimation

**Question:** "Will this policy pay for itself?"

**Process:**
1. Load representative sample (e.g., 200,000 tax returns representing 150M filers)
2. Apply current law rules → aggregate revenue
3. Apply reformed rules → aggregate revenue
4. Difference = revenue impact

**Output:**
```
Baseline revenue: $2.1 trillion
Reformed revenue: $1.9 trillion
Cost: $200 billion
```

### 2. Distributional Analysis

**Question:** "Who wins and loses?"

**Process:**
1. Calculate current tax for each household
2. Calculate reformed tax for each household
3. Group by income quintile (bottom 20%, next 20%, ...)
4. Average change by group

**Output:**
```
Income Group       Average Change    % Benefit
Bottom 20%         +$2,000           +15%
Second 20%         +$500             +2%
Middle 20%         $0                0%
Fourth 20%         -$300             -1%
Top 20%            -$5,000           -2%

Conclusion: Progressive (helps lower incomes)
```

### 3. Policy Reform Testing

**Question:** "What if we change X?"

**Scenarios:**
- Increase standard deduction by $5,000
- Expand EITC to childless workers
- Add new child allowance
- Change capital gains rate
- Phase out deductions for high earners

**Output:** Revenue cost, distributional impact, administrative complexity

### 4. Marginal Tax Rate Analysis

**Question:** "What's my incentive to earn one more dollar?"

**Why it matters:**
- High MTRs discourage work
- Phase-outs can create 50%+ MTRs
- Benefits phase-outs add to tax MTRs

**Output:**
```
Income Level    Federal MTR    State MTR    EITC Phase-out    Effective MTR
$25,000         12%           5%           21%               38%
$50,000         22%           5%           0%                27%
$500,000        37%           10%          0%                47%
```

## Scope of This Research

This survey covers:

### In Scope
- **Microsimulation engines:** Apply rules to population samples
- **Tax-benefit systems:** Income tax, payroll tax, refundable credits
- **Country-specific models:** US, UK, France (major implementations)
- **Open-source libraries:** Publicly available, reproducible

### Out of Scope
- **Proprietary models:** Government/think tank internal tools
- **Commercial tax software:** TurboTax, H&R Block (compliance, not modeling)
- **Sales tax APIs:** TaxJar, Avalara (transaction-level, not policy analysis)
- **Spreadsheet models:** Ad-hoc Excel/Google Sheets calculators
- **Dynamic scoring:** Behavioral response models (future research)

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **Policy analysts** (government, think tanks)
2. **Academic researchers** (economics, public finance)
3. **Advocacy organizations** (evaluating proposals)
4. **Journalists** (fact-checking, explainers)

### User Needs
- **Transparency:** See how calculations work
- **Reproducibility:** Others can verify results
- **Flexibility:** Test novel policy ideas
- **Accuracy:** Match official government projections
- **Performance:** Simulate 150M+ people in reasonable time

### Required Skills
- Python programming (intermediate)
- Tax policy knowledge (understand terms like AGI, MAGI, credits)
- Statistics (survey weighting, sampling)
- Microdata experience (Census, IRS data)

**Learning curve:** 2-3 months to become productive

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

### Problem 1: Multi-State Complexity
- Most tools focus on federal taxes
- State income taxes have 43 different rule sets
- Federal-state interactions (SALT deduction)
- Cross-border workers (NY resident, NJ job)

**Gap:** No comprehensive open-source multi-state model (until PolicyEngine 2024)

### Problem 2: Property Tax
- 1/3 of state/local revenue
- 3,000+ counties with unique rules
- Complex exemptions (homestead, senior, agricultural)
- **Gap:** No open-source property tax library exists

### Problem 3: Sales Tax Research
- 11,000+ jurisdictions
- Product-specific exemptions
- **Gap:** Commercial APIs exist (TaxJar), but not for policy research
  - Too expensive for academics
  - Not designed for counterfactual analysis

### Problem 4: Integration
- Comprehensive tax burden = income + payroll + property + sales
- Each tax type has separate tools (if any)
- **Gap:** No unified household tax burden calculator

## Success Criteria

A successful public finance modeling library should:

1. **Encode official rules accurately** (validation against published examples)
2. **Handle edge cases** (AMT, child tax credit phase-outs, NIIT)
3. **Scale to full population** (150M+ tax units in US)
4. **Support counterfactual reforms** (easy to modify rules)
5. **Provide distributional outputs** (by income, age, geography)
6. **Be maintainable** (annual tax law changes)
7. **Have comprehensive tests** (known correct answers)
8. **Offer good documentation** (examples, not just API reference)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Data Privacy
- Microdata contains sensitive info (income, family structure)
- Public Use Files (PUFs) have reduced detail
- Some models use synthetic data (algorithmically generated)

### Computational Performance
- 150M tax units × 100+ calculations each = 15B operations
- Need efficient vectorized operations (NumPy)
- Typically 5-30 seconds per full simulation

### Version Control
- Tax laws change every year (TCJA sunset in 2026)
- Need to model historical years (for research)
- Parameters vs. structure (rate changes vs. new provisions)

### International Portability
- OpenFisca approach: Core engine + country packages
- Challenge: Each country has unique concepts (France: "quotient familial", US: "filing status")

## Related Problems

These research areas intersect with public finance modeling:

- **1.094 Constraint Solving:** Budget optimization (maximize benefits, minimize tax)
- **1.101 PDF Processing:** Extract tables from tax forms (IRS instructions)
- **1.301 Government Data Access:** APIs for Census, IRS, BLS data
- **1.302 Budget Document Parsing:** Extract spending data from CAFRs
- **1.303 Civic Entity Resolution:** Match taxpayers across datasets

## Why This Matters

**Quote from Tax Policy Center:**
> "Microsimulation models have become the standard for analyzing tax proposals. Without them, policy debates would rely on guesswork and ideology rather than evidence."

**Real impact:**
- UK Treasury uses PolicyEngine for Universal Credit analysis (8M households)
- US CBO uses Tax-Calculator for official revenue scores
- France runs its social benefit system on OpenFisca code

**Benefit:** Better-informed policy, fewer unintended consequences, transparent debate.

## 4. Cost-of-Capital-Calculator (CCC)

**Links:** [Website](https://ccc.pslmodels.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Cost-of-Capital-Calculator)

**Language:** Python
**License:** CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)
**Maintenance:** Active (latest release: 2.1.0 on Aug 25, 2025, 19 stars, 1,781 commits)
**Python Support:** 3.11-3.13

### Description

Cost-of-Capital-Calculator (CCC) evaluates how US federal taxes affect corporate and non-corporate investment incentives. It computes marginal effective tax rates (METRs) on new investments by combining business asset data with individual tax filer microdata. CCC is part of the Policy Simulation Library ecosystem and integrates with Tax-Calculator.

**Design philosophy:**
- Business tax analysis complement to Tax-Calculator
- Academic foundation (Jorgenson-Hall cost of capital framework)
- Integration of entity and shareholder taxation
- Focus on investment incentives, not revenue estimation

### Key Features

- **Marginal effective tax rates:** Cost of capital by asset type and industry
- **Corporate & non-corporate:** Pass-through entities and C-corporations
- **Individual integration:** Models taxation at both entity and shareholder levels
- **Depreciation schedules:** Handles complex depreciation rules (MACRS, bonus depreciation)
- **Policy scenarios:** Analyze investment incentive effects of tax reforms
- **Tax-Calculator integration:** Combines business and individual tax modeling
- **Web interface:** Available at ccc.pslmodels.org (limited functionality)
- **Asset-level detail:** 96 asset types, 10 financing strategies

### Concepts

**Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR):**

**Interpretation:**
- METR = 0%: No tax distortion (tax doesn't affect investment)
- METR = 20%: Tax increases required return by 25% (1/0.8 - 1)
- METR < 0%: Tax subsidy (encourages investment)

### Installation

### Example Usage

### Notable Users

- **Academic researchers:** Studying corporate taxation and investment
- **Policy analysts:** Evaluating business tax reforms (R&D credits, depreciation)
- **Think tanks:** Combined with Tax-Calculator for comprehensive tax analysis

### Strengths

1. **Unique focus:** Only open-source business tax library
2. **Academic rigor:** Based on established economic framework
3. **Integration:** Works with Tax-Calculator
4. **Asset detail:** 96 asset types
5. **Public domain:** No licensing restrictions

---

## Gaps Remain

Even with these excellent tools, gaps persist:

1. **Property tax:** No open-source library (3,000+ counties)
2. **Sales tax research:** Commercial APIs exist, not policy modeling tools
3. **Multi-jurisdictional:** Cross-border workers, part-year residents
4. **Behavioral responses:** All tools are static models
5. **Integration:** No unified household tax burden calculator (income + property + sales)

See S3 (Solution Space) for approaches to these gaps.

# S3: Solution Space - Approaches to Filling Gaps

## Overview

This section explores approaches to building new public finance modeling tools, addressing the gaps identified in S1 and S2. We focus on three major gaps:

1. Property tax calculation libraries
2. Sales tax modeling for policy research
3. Multi-jurisdictional integration

---

## Gap 1: Property Tax Calculation Libraries

### The Problem

Property tax generates ~$600B annually in the US (1/3 of state/local revenue), yet there's no open-source calculation library. Current state:

- **Data availability:** Many jurisdictions publish assessment data (open data portals)
- **No calculation engine:** Data exists, but no library to compute taxes
- **Extreme locality:** 3,000+ counties, each with unique rules

### Approach 1A: Top-N Metro Areas (Incremental)

**Strategy:** Start with largest metro areas, expand incrementally

**Steps:**
1. Identify top 50 metro areas by population (~60% of US)
2. For each metro, encode:
   - Assessment methodology (market value, Prop 13, use-based)
   - Rate structures (mill levies, voter overrides)
   - Exemptions (homestead, senior, veteran, agricultural)
   - Special districts (school, fire, library)
3. Build validation dataset (scrape public tax bills)
4. Create Python library with pluggable jurisdiction modules

**Example API:**

**Pros:**
- Focused scope (50 metros is achievable)
- High impact (covers majority of US population)
- Incremental validation (one jurisdiction at a time)

**Cons:**
- Still substantial work (50+ jurisdictions)
- Annual maintenance (rate changes, new levies)
- Incomplete coverage (rural areas, small cities)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 person-years for initial 50 metros

---

### Approach 1B: Crowdsourced Rule Encoding

**Strategy:** Build framework, let community contribute jurisdiction rules

**Inspired by:** OpenFisca's country-package model

**Steps:**
1. Create core engine (exemption logic, rate application, aggregation)
2. Define jurisdiction rule DSL (domain-specific language):
   
3. Provide tools for validation (compare calculated vs. actual bills)
4. Gamify contributions (leaderboard, jurisdiction coverage map)

**Pros:**
- Scales beyond any single team's capacity
- Community ownership → sustainability
- Framework reusable across all jurisdictions

**Cons:**
- Slow initial adoption (cold-start problem)
- Quality variance (need review process)
- Complex rules hard to encode (edge cases)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 person-year for framework, 3-5 years to 500+ jurisdictions

---

### Approach 1C: ML-Assisted Estimation

**Strategy:** Train models on assessment + tax bill data, skip rule encoding

**Steps:**
1. Scrape public data (assessments, tax bills)
2. Features: `[assessed_value, location, property_type, size, age, ...]`
3. Target: `total_tax`
4. Train gradient boosting model (XGBoost, LightGBM)
5. Validate against holdout jurisdictions

**Pros:**
- No manual rule encoding needed
- Works even where rules are unclear
- Handles complex interactions automatically

**Cons:**
- Black box (can't explain calculations)
- Requires substantial data (10k+ tax bills per jurisdiction)
- No counterfactual policy analysis (can't model "what if senior exemption increased")
- Legal/transparency concerns (how was this calculated?)

**Use case:** Rough estimates for real estate platforms, NOT policy analysis

**Estimated Effort:** 6 months for prototype, 1 year for production

---

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid 1A + 1B

**Phase 1:** Core team builds top 20 metros (Approach 1A)
- Proves viability
- Establishes patterns
- Creates validation methodology

**Phase 2:** Open to community (Approach 1B)
- Core team provides framework + examples
- Community contributes remaining metros
- Maintains quality through validation tools

**Why not 1C?** ML approach unsuitable for policy analysis (primary use case)

---

## Gap 2: Sales Tax Modeling for Policy Research

### The Problem

Commercial APIs (TaxJar, Avalara) exist for e-commerce compliance but:
- Expensive for research use ($1000s/month)
- Not designed for counterfactual analysis
- No access to underlying rate database
- Address-level precision unnecessary for policy modeling

**Research needs:** "What if we exempt groceries?" not "What tax for this exact address?"

### Approach 2A: Open Rate Database (Snapshot)

**Strategy:** Public database of sales tax rates, quarterly updates

**Scope:**
- State rates (all 50)
- County rates (top 200 by population)
- City rates (top 100 by population)
- Coverage: ~70-80% of US sales transactions

**Data sources:**
- State revenue department websites (public data)
- Municipal code databases
- Federation of Tax Administrators publications

**Database schema:**

**Example:**

**Pros:**
- Open data (no API fees)
- Sufficient for research (don't need 11,000 jurisdictions)
- Quarterly updates adequate
- Enables policy modeling

**Cons:**
- Manual maintenance (quarterly scraping)
- Not suitable for real-time compliance
- Product categories broad (no UPC-level)

**Estimated Effort:** 3 months for initial build, 1 week/quarter maintenance

---

### Approach 2B: Microsimulation Integration

**Strategy:** Combine rate database (2A) with consumer expenditure data

**Data source:** Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) from BLS

**Steps:**
1. Load CEX microdata (household expenditures by category)
2. Map CEX categories to tax categories:
   
3. For each household, calculate sales tax:
   
4. Aggregate: total revenue, by income quintile, by state

**Policy analysis:**

**Pros:**
- Answers key policy questions
- Distributional analysis (regressivity)
- Integration with existing tools (Tax-Calculator)

**Cons:**
- CEX has small sample (~20k households)
- Measurement error in expenditures
- Doesn't capture behavioral responses

**Estimated Effort:** 6 months (assuming 2A completed)

---

### Approach 2C: Collaborate with Commercial Providers

**Strategy:** Partner with TaxJar/Avalara for research access

**Model:**
- Commercial providers offer API access for research (reduced rate or free)
- Academic/nonprofit researchers use for policy analysis
- Providers benefit from research visibility

**Precedent:**
- Google Cloud academic grants
- AWS research credits
- Qualtrics academic licenses

**Pros:**
- No need to maintain rate database
- Access to full 11,000 jurisdictions
- Real-time accuracy

**Cons:**
- Dependent on provider cooperation
- May have usage limits
- Not truly open-source
- Commercial entity could terminate access

**Estimated Effort:** 3 months to negotiate partnership

---

### Recommended Approach: 2A + 2B

**Why not 2C?** Dependency on commercial entity undermines open research principles

**Implementation:**
1. Build open rate database (2A) - 3 months
2. Create microsimulation module (2B) - 6 months
3. Validate against state revenue reports
4. Publish as library + dataset

---

## Gap 3: Multi-Jurisdictional Integration

### The Problem

Comprehensive tax burden requires integrating:
- Federal income tax (Tax-Calculator ✓)
- State income tax (PolicyEngine ✓)
- Property tax (Gap 1)
- Sales tax (Gap 2)

**Challenge:** Each tax has different data requirements, computation order, interactions

### Approach 3A: Orchestration Layer

**Strategy:** Build wrapper that coordinates existing + new tools

**Architecture:**

**Coordination challenges:**
- Data harmonization (different income definitions)
- Computation order (federal affects state via SALT deduction)
- Entity mapping (tax units vs. households vs. individuals)

**Pros:**
- Leverages existing tools
- No duplication of effort
- Can start before Gaps 1 & 2 fully solved

**Cons:**
- Brittle (depends on all upstream libraries)
- API mismatches (different conventions)
- Version incompatibilities

**Estimated Effort:** 6 months for orchestration layer

---

### Approach 3B: Unified Microsimulation

**Strategy:** Build comprehensive model from scratch (like OpenFisca, but US + all taxes)

**Scope:**
- Federal income + payroll
- 50 state income taxes
- Property tax (top metros)
- Sales tax (policy-level)

**Pros:**
- Consistent API
- Optimized performance
- Designed for integration from start

**Cons:**
- Massive duplication of effort
- 5-10 person-years to match existing tools
- Maintenance burden enormous

**Verdict:** Not recommended (reinventing wheel)

---

### Approach 3C: Incremental Integration into PolicyEngine

**Strategy:** Contribute property + sales modules to PolicyEngine-US

**Rationale:**
- PolicyEngine already has federal + 50 states
- Active development, responsive maintainers
- Would create most comprehensive US model

**Steps:**
1. Propose integration to PolicyEngine team
2. Build property tax module using PolicyEngine's framework
3. Build sales tax module
4. Submit PRs, iterate with maintainers

**Pros:**
- Single comprehensive tool
- Maintained by nonprofit
- Leverages PolicyEngine's web app
- Community benefits

**Cons:**
- Dependent on PolicyEngine roadmap
- Must conform to their architecture
- Governance not under your control

**Estimated Effort:** 1 year (if accepted by PolicyEngine)

---

### Recommended Approach: 3A (Short-term) + 3C (Long-term)

**Phase 1:** Build orchestration layer (3A)
- Proves value of integration
- Works with current tools
- 6 months

**Phase 2:** Contribute to PolicyEngine (3C)
- Approach PolicyEngine team with working prototype
- Discuss integration
- If accepted: dedicate resources to contribution
- If not: maintain orchestration layer

---

## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1: Sales Tax Research Tools (Gap 2)
- **Rationale:** Highest impact/effort ratio
- **Approach:** 2A + 2B (open rate database + microsimulation)
- **Timeline:** 9 months
- **Users:** State policy analysts, think tanks, academics

### Priority 2: Property Tax (Top 20 Metros) (Gap 1)
- **Rationale:** Proof of concept for larger effort
- **Approach:** 1A (top metros, then expand)
- **Timeline:** 1 year for top 20
- **Users:** Local governments, real estate platforms, researchers

### Priority 3: Multi-Jurisdictional Integration (Gap 3)
- **Rationale:** Enables comprehensive tax burden analysis
- **Approach:** 3A (orchestration layer)
- **Timeline:** 6 months (after Gaps 1 & 2 progress)
- **Users:** Researchers studying overall tax progressivity

---

## Cross-Cutting Technical Decisions

- Apache 2.0: If need contributor agreements
- NOT AGPL: Want to enable commercial use (real estate, compliance)

### Data Format: Parquet
- Efficient columnar storage
- Fast reads (pandas, Polars)
- Cross-language (R, Python, Julia)

### Documentation: Jupyter Notebooks
- Examples with real data
- Narrative + code
- Reproducible

### Testing: Extensive Validation
- Known correct answers (published tax bills)
- Edge cases (phase-outs, cliffs)
- Regression tests (changes don't break existing)

### Web API: Optional
- Start with Python library (CLI + API)
- Add REST API if demand exists
- Learn from PolicyEngine's web app success

### Use Case 1: US Federal Tax Policy Analysis

**Recommendation:** Tax-Calculator

**Why:**
- CBO uses it (official validation)
- Public domain license
- Most cited in academic literature
- Comprehensive federal tax modeling

**When to use PolicyEngine instead:**
- Need state taxes
- Want web interface
- Non-programmer audience

---

### Use Case 2: US State + Federal Integration

**Recommendation:** PolicyEngine US

**Why:**
- Only tool with all 50 states (as of 2024)
- Active development
- Web app for accessibility

**Limitations:**
- AGPL license (if building commercial product)
- State models new (need more validation)

---

### Use Case 3: International (Non-US)

**Recommendation:** OpenFisca

**Why:**
- Proven in multiple countries
- Core engine language-agnostic
- Government adoption (France, Tunisia)

**Check:** Does country package exist? Quality varies.

---

### Use Case 4: Business Tax / Investment Analysis

**Recommendation:** Cost-of-Capital-Calculator

**Why:**
- Only open-source business tax tool
- Integrates with Tax-Calculator
- Based on established economic framework

**Combine with:** Tax-Calculator for comprehensive analysis

---

### Use Case 5: Property Tax (Future)

**Recommendation:** Build new tool (none exist)

**Approach:** See S3 (Approach 1A: Top metros, incremental)

**Evaluation criteria when choosing approach:**
- Incremental (1A) scores high on feasibility, moderate on coverage
- Crowdsourced (1B) scores high on coverage, moderate on feasibility
- ML (1C) scores high on automation, low on explainability

**For policy research:** Avoid ML (1C), prefer rule-based (1A/1B)

---

### Use Case 6: Sales Tax Research (Future)

**Recommendation:** Build new tool (commercial APIs not suitable)

**Approach:** See S3 (Approach 2A + 2B: Open rate database + microsimulation)

**Why not TaxJar/Avalara:**
- Expensive ($1000+/month)
- Not designed for counterfactual analysis
- No access to underlying data

## Decision Matrix for New Tool Development

### Should You Build a New Tool?

| Question | If YES → | If NO → |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Does existing tool cover this? | Use existing | Consider building |
| Can you contribute to existing? | Contribute | Build standalone |
| Do you have 2+ person-years? | Maybe build | Probably don't |
| Is there ongoing funding? | Maybe build | Probably don't |
| Are users waiting? | Build | Don't build |

### Example: Property Tax Tool

- Existing tool? **NO** → Consider building
- Contribute to existing? **NO** (none exist) → Build standalone
- Resources? **YES** (grant-funded) → Build
- Funding? **YES** (3-year grant) → Build
- Users? **YES** (real estate platforms, local govs) → **BUILD**

### Example: Better OpenFisca Web UI

- Existing tool? **YES** (OpenFisca has web API) → Use existing
- Contribute to existing? **YES** (open-source) → **CONTRIBUTE**, don't fork
- Resources? Doesn't matter → Contribute
- Funding? Doesn't matter → Contribute
- Users? Doesn't matter → Contribute

## Red Flags: When NOT to Build

1. **Duplicating Tax-Calculator:** Federal US taxes are solved problem
2. **Country-specific without maintenance plan:** Will bitrot with annual tax changes
3. **Proprietary data requirements:** Users can't access = tool unusable
4. **No validation strategy:** How will you know if it's correct?
5. **One-person project, no succession:** Bus factor = 1
6. **"Better OpenFisca" without distinct value:** Just contribute instead

---

## Green Lights: When TO Build

1. **Clear gap:** No existing open-source solution (property tax, sales tax research)
2. **User demand:** Researchers/policymakers asking for it
3. **Validation path:** Can compare to official statistics
4. **Maintenance plan:** Funding for 3+ years
5. **Interoperability:** Works with existing tools
6. **Unique value:** Can't be achieved by contributing to existing tool

---

## Summary: Choosing Wisely

**For using existing tools:**
- US federal: Tax-Calculator (academic) or PolicyEngine (accessible)
- US state: PolicyEngine US (only comprehensive option)
- International: OpenFisca (if country package exists)
- Business tax: Cost-of-Capital-Calculator

**For building new tools:**
- Property tax: High priority, clear gap, user demand ✅
- Sales tax research: Medium priority, clear gap, moderate demand ✅
- Multi-jurisdictional: Build orchestration, contribute to PolicyEngine ✅
- Duplicate existing: Don't do it ❌

**The golden rule:** Contribute to existing tools when possible, build new tools when necessary.
